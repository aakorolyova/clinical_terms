Cardiovascular / Pulmonary,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES, Airway obstruction secondary to severe subglottic tracheal stenosis with foreign body in the trachea., POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES, Airway obstruction secondary to severe subglottic tracheal stenosis with foreign body in the trachea., OPERATION PERFORMED, Neck exploration; tracheostomy; urgent flexible bronchoscopy via tracheostomy site; removal of foreign body, tracheal metallic stent material; dilation distal trachea; placement of #8 Shiley single cannula tracheostomy tube., INDICATIONS FOR SURGERY, The patient is a 50-year-old white male with history of progressive tracheomalacia treated in the National Tennessee, and several years ago he had a tracheal metallic stent placed with some temporary improvement."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, However developed progressive problems and he had two additional stents placed with some initial improvement.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," Subsequently, he developed progressive airway obstruction and came into the ABC Hospital critical airway service for further evaluation and was admitted on Month DD, YYYY."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, He underwent bronchoscopy by Dr. W and found to have an extensive subglottic upper tracheal and distal tracheal stenosis secondary to metallic stent extensive granulation and inflammatory tissue changes.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, The patient had some debridement and then was hospitalized and Laryngology and Thoracic Surgery services were consulted for further management.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," Exploration of trachea, removal of foreign body stents constricting his airway, dilation and stabilization of his trachea were offered to the patient."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," Nature of the proposed procedure including risks and complications of bleeding, infection, alteration of voice, speech, swallowing, voice changes permanently, possibility of tracheotomy temporarily or permanently to maintain his airway, loss of voice, cardiac risk factors, anesthetic risks, recurrence of problems, upon surgical intervention were all discussed at length."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," The patient stated that he understood and wished to proceed., DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE, The patient was taken to the operating room, placed in the supine position."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," Following adequate monitoring by Anesthesia Service to maintain sedation, the patient's neck was prepped and draped in the sterile fashion."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, The neck was then infiltrated with 1% Xylocaine and 1000 epinephrine.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," A collar incision approximately 1 fingerbreadth above the clavicle, this was an outline incision, was carried out."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," The skin, subcutaneous tissue, platysma, subplatysmal flaps elevated superiorly and inferiorly."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," Strap muscles were separated in the midline, dissection carried down to visceral fascia."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," Beneath the strap muscles, there was dense inflammation scarring obscuring palpable landmarks."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, There appeared to be significant scarring fusion of soft tissue at the perichondrium and cartilage of the cricoid making the cricoid easily definable.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, There was a markedly enlarged thyroid isthmus.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," Thyroid isthmus was divided and dense inflammation, attachment of the thyroid isthmus, fusion of the thyroid gland to the capsule to the pretracheal fascia requiring extensive blunt sharp dissection."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, Trachea was exposed from the cricoid to the fourth ring which entered down into the chest.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, The trachea was incised between the second and third ring inferior limb in the midline and excision of small ridge of cartilage on each side sent for pathologic evaluation.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," The tracheal cartilage externally had marked thickening and significant stiffness calcification, and the tracheal wall from the outside of the trachea to the mucosa measured 3 to 4 mm in thickness."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, The trachea was entered and visualized with thickening of the mucosa and submucosa was noted.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," The patient, however, was able to ventilate at this point a #6 Endo Tube was inserted and general anesthesia administered."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," Once the airway was secured, we then proceeded working around the #6 Endo Tube as well as with the tube intake and out to explore the trachea with ridged fiberoptic scopes as well as flexible fiberoptic bronchoscopy to the trach site."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, Examination revealed extrusion of metallic fragments from stent and multiple metallic fragments were removed from the stent in the upper trachea.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, A careful examination of the subglottic area showed inflamed and thickened mucosa but patent subglottis.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," After removal of the stents and granulation tissue, the upper trachea was widely patent."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, The mid trachea had some marked narrowing secondary to granulation.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, Stent material was removed from this area as well.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," In the distal third of the trachea, a third stent was embedded within the mucosa, not encroaching on the lumen without significant obstruction distally and this was not disturbed at this time."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, All visible stent material in the upper and mid trachea were removed.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, Initial attempt to place a #16 Montgomery T tube showed the distal lumen of the T tube to be too short to stent the granulation narrowing of the trachea at the junction of the anterior two thirds and the distal third.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," Also, this was removed and a #8 Shiley single cannula tracheostomy tube was placed after removal of the endotracheal tube."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, A good ventilation was confirmed and the position of the tube confirmed it to be at the level just above the metallic stent which was embedded in the mucosa.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, The distal trachea and mainstem bronchi were widely patent.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, This secured his airway and no further manipulation felt to be needed at this time.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, Neck wound was thoroughly irrigated and strap muscles were closed with interrupted 3-0 Vicryl.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, The skin laterally to the trach site was closed with running 2-0 Prolene.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, Tracheostomy tube was secured with interrupted 2-0 silk sutures and the patient was taken back to the Intensive Care Unit in satisfactory condition.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, The patient tolerated the procedure well without complication.

Neurology,"Doctor's Address, Dear Doctor:, This letter is an introduction to my patient, A, who you will be seeing in the near future."
Neurology, He is a pleasant gentleman with a history of Wilson's disease.
Neurology, It has been treated with penicillamine.
Neurology, He was diagnosed with this at age 14.
Neurology," He was on his way to South Carolina for a trip when he developed shortness of breath, palpitations, and chest discomfort."
Neurology," He went to the closest hospital that they were near in Randolph, North Carolina and he was found to be in atrial fibrillation with rapid rate."
Neurology, He was admitted there and observed.
Neurology, He converted to normal sinus rhythm spontaneously and so he required no further interventions.
Neurology," He was started on Lopressor, which he has tolerated well."
Neurology," An echocardiogram was performed, which revealed mild-to-moderate left atrial enlargement."
Neurology, Normal ejection fraction.
Neurology, No other significant valvular abnormality.
Neurology, He reported to physicians there that he had cirrhosis related to his Wilson's disease.
Neurology, Therefore hepatologist was consulted.
Neurology," There was a recommendation to avoid Coumadin secondary to his questionable significant liver disease, therefore he was placed on aspirin 325 mg once a day.,"
Neurology,"In discussion with Mr. A and review of his chart that I have available, it is unclear as to the status of his liver disease, however, he has never had a liver biopsy, so his diagnosis of cirrhosis that they were concerned about in North Carolina is in doubt."
Neurology, His LFTs have remained normal and his copper level has been undetectable on his current dose of penicillamine.
Neurology,", I would appreciate your input into the long term management of his anticoagulation and also any recommendations you would have about rhythm control."
Neurology, He is in normal sinus rhythm as of my evaluation of him on 06/12/2008.
Neurology, He is tolerating his metoprolol and aspirin without any difficulty.
Neurology, I guess the big question remains is what level of risk that is entailed by placing him on Coumadin therapy due to his potentially paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and evidence of left atrial enlargement that would place him in increased risk of recurrent episodes.
Neurology,", I appreciate your input regarding this friendly gentleman."
Neurology," His current medicines include penicillamine 250 mg p.o. four times a day, metoprolol 12.5 mg twice a day, and aspirin 325 mg a day."
Neurology,", If you have any questions regarding his care, please feel free to call me to discuss his case."
Neurology," Otherwise, I will look forward to hearing back from you regarding his evaluation."
Neurology, Thank you as always for your care of our patient.

Neurology," The nerve was transposed anteriorly, superficial to the flexor-pronator mass."
Neurology," Motor branches were dissected proximally and distally to avoid tethering or kinking the ulnar nerve.,"
Neurology,A semicircular medially based flap of flexor-pronator fascia was raised and sutured to the subcutaneous tissue in such a way as to prevent the nerve from relocating.
Neurology, The subcutaneous tissue and skin were closed with simple interrupted sutures.
Neurology, Marcaine with epinephrine was injected into the wound.
Neurology, The elbow was dressed and splinted.
Neurology," The patient was awakened and sent to the recovery room in good condition, having tolerated the procedure well."
Neurology,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Headaches, question of temporal arteritis., POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Headaches, question of temporal arteritis., PROCEDURE:,  Bilateral temporal artery biopsies., DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: , After obtaining an informed consent, the patient was brought to the operating room where her right temporal area was prepped and draped in the usual fashion."
Neurology, Xylocaine 1% was utilized and then an incision was made in front of the right ear and deepened anteriorly.
Neurology, The temporal artery was found and exposed in an extension of about 2 cm.
Neurology, The artery was proximally and distally ligated with 6-0 Prolene and also a side branch and a sample was sent for pathology.
Neurology," Hemostasis achieved with a cautery and the incision was closed with a subcuticular suture of Monocryl., Then, the patient was turned and her left temporal area was prepped and draped in the usual fashion."
Neurology," A similar procedure was performed with 1% Xylocaine and exposed her temporal artery, which was excised in an extent to about 2 cm."
Neurology, This was also proximally and distally ligated with 6-0 Prolene and also side branch.
Neurology," Hemostasis was achieved with a cautery and the skin was closed with a subcuticular suture of Monocryl., Dressings were applied to both areas."
Neurology,", The patient tolerated the procedure well."
Neurology," Estimated blood loss was negligible, and the patient went back to Same Day Surgery for recovery."
Neurology,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Rule out temporal arteritis., POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  , Rule out temporal arteritis., PROCEDURE:,  Bilateral temporal artery biopsy., ANESTHESIA:,  Local anesthesia 1% Xylocaine with epinephrine., INDICATIONS:,"
Neurology, I was consulted by Dr. X for this patient with bilateral temporal headaches to rule out temporal arteritis.
Neurology," I explained fully the procedure to the patient.,"
Neurology,"PROCEDURE: , Both sides were done exactly the same way."
Neurology," After 1% Xylocaine infiltration, a 2 to 3-cm incision was made over the temporal artery."
Neurology, The temporal artery was identified and was grossly normal on both sides.
Neurology, Proximal and distal were ligated with both of 3-0 silk suture and Hemoccult.
Neurology, The specimen of temporal artery was taken from both sides measuring at least 2 to 3 cm.
Neurology," They were sent as separate specimens, right and left labeled."
Neurology, The wound was then closed with interrupted 3-0 Monocryl subcuticular sutures and Dermabond.
Neurology, She tolerated the procedure well.
Neurology,"REASON FOR CONSULTATION: , This 92-year-old female states that last night she had a transient episode of slurred speech and numbness of her left cheek for a few hours."
Neurology," However, the chart indicates that she had recurrent TIAs x3 yesterday, each lasting about 5 minutes with facial drooping and some mental confusion."
Neurology, She had also complained of blurred vision for several days.
Neurology," She was brought to the emergency room last night, where she was noted to have a left carotid bruit and was felt to have recurrent TIAs., CURRENT MEDICATIONS: , The patient is on Lanoxin, amoxicillin, Hydergine, Cardizem, Lasix, Micro-K and a salt-free diet."
Neurology," , SOCIAL HISTORY: , She does not smoke or drink alcohol., FINDINGS:  , Admission CT scan of the head showed a densely calcified mass lesion of the sphenoid bone, probably representing the benign osteochondroma seen on previous studies."
Neurology," CBC was normal, aside from a hemoglobin of 11.2."
Neurology, ECG showed atrial fibrillation.
Neurology," BUN was 22, creatinine normal, CPK normal, glucose normal, electrolytes normal., PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: , On examination, the patient is noted to be alert and fully oriented."

Neurology, Speech is normal and clear.
Neurology, The head is noted to be normocephalic.
Neurology, Neck is supple.
Neurology," Carotid pulses are full bilaterally, with left carotid bruit."
Neurology," Neurologic exam shows cranial nerve function II through XII to be intact, save for some slight flattening of the left nasolabial fold."
Neurology, Motor examination shows no drift of the outstretched arms.
Neurology, There is no tremor or past-pointing.
Neurology, Finger-to-nose and heel-to-shin performed well bilaterally.
Neurology," Motor showed intact neuromuscular tone, strength, and coordination in all limbs."
Neurology," Reflexes 1+ and symmetrical, with bilateral plantar flexion, absent jaw jerk, no snout."
Neurology," Sensory exam is intact to pinprick touch, vibration, position, temperature, and graphesthesia., IMPRESSION: , Neurological examination is normal, aside from mild impairment of recent memory, slight flattening of the left nasolabial fold, and left carotid bruit."
Neurology," She also has atrial fibrillation, apparently chronic."
Neurology," In view of her age and the fact that she is in chronic atrial fibrillation, I would suspect that she most likely has had an embolic phenomenon as the cause of her TIAs., RECOMMENDATIONS:,  I would recommend conservative management with antiplatelet agents unless a near occlusion of the carotid arteries is demonstrated, in which case you might consider it best to do an angiography and consider endarterectomy."
Neurology," In view of her age, I would be reluctant to recommend Coumadin anticoagulation."
Neurology, I will be happy to follow the patient with you.
Neurology,"REASON FOR VISIT: , The patient referred by Dr. X for evaluation of her possible tethered cord., HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:,  Briefly, she is a 14-year-old right handed female who is in 9th grade, who underwent a lipomyomeningocele repair at 3 days of age and then again at 3-1/2 years of age."
Neurology, The last surgery was in 03/95.
Neurology," She did well; however, in the past several months has had some leg pain in both legs out laterally, worsening at night and requiring Advil, Motrin as well as Tylenol PM., Denies any new bowel or bladder dysfunction or increased sensory loss."
Neurology," She had some patchy sensory loss from L4 to S1., MEDICATIONS: , Singulair for occasional asthma., FINDINGS: , She is awake, alert, and oriented x 3."
Neurology, Pupils equal and reactive.
Neurology, EOMs are full.
Neurology, Motor is 5 out of 5.
Neurology, She was able to toe and heel walk without any difficulties as well as tendon reflexes were 2 plus.
Neurology, There is no evidence of clonus.
Neurology," There is diminished sensation from L4 to S1, having proprioception., ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: , Possible tethered cord."
Neurology, I had a thorough discussion with the patient and her parents.
Neurology, I have recommended a repeat MRI scan.
Neurology, The prescription was given today.
Neurology, MRI of the lumbar spine was just completed.
Neurology, I would like to see her back in clinic.
Neurology, We did discuss the possible symptoms of this tethering.
Neurology,"TITLE OF OPERATION: , Right suboccipital craniectomy for resection of tumor using the microscope modifier 22 and cranioplasty., INDICATION FOR SURGERY: , The patient with a large 3.5 cm acoustic neuroma."
Neurology, The patient is having surgery for resection.
Neurology, There was significant cerebellar peduncle compression.
Neurology, The tumor was very difficult due to its size as well as its adherence to the brainstem and the nerve complex.
Neurology, The case took 12 hours.
Neurology," This was more difficult and took longer than the usual acoustic neuroma., PREOP DIAGNOSIS: , Right acoustic neuroma., POSTOP DIAGNOSIS: , Right acoustic neuroma., PROCEDURE:,  The patient was brought to the operating room."
Neurology, General anesthesia was induced in the usual fashion.
Neurology," After appropriate lines were placed, the patient was placed in Mayfield 3-point head fixation, hold into a right park bench position to expose the right suboccipital area."
Neurology," A time-out was settled with nursing and anesthesia, and the head was shaved, prescrubbed with chlorhexidine, prepped and draped in the usual fashion."
Neurology, The incision was made and cautery was used to expose the suboccipital bone.
Neurology," Once the suboccipital bone was exposed under the foramen magnum, the high speed drill was used to thin out the suboccipital bone and the craniectomy carried out with Leksell and insertion with Kerrison punches down to the rim of the foramen magnum as well as laterally to the edge of the sigmoid sinus and superiorly to the edge of the transverse sinus."
Neurology," The dura was then opened in a cruciate fashion, the cisterna magna was drained, which nicely relaxed the cerebellum."
Neurology, The dura leaves were held back with the 4-0 Nurolon.
Neurology," The microscope was then brought into the field, and under the microscope, the cerebellar hemisphere was elevated."
Neurology," Laterally, the arachnoid was very thick."
Neurology, This was opened with bipolar and microscissors and this allowed for the cerebellum to be further mobilized until the tumor was identified.
Neurology, The tumor was quite large and filled up the entire lateral aspect of the right posterior fossa.
Neurology," Initially two retractors were used, one on the tentorium and one inferiorly."
Neurology, The arachnoid was taken down off the tumor.
Neurology," There were multiple blood vessels on the surface, which were bipolared."
Neurology, The tumor surface was then opened with microscissors and the Cavitron was used to began debulking the lesion.
Neurology," This was a very difficult resection due to the extreme stickiness and adherence to the cerebellar peduncle and the lateral cerebellum; however, as the tumor was able to be debulked, the edge began to be mobilized."
Neurology, The redundant capsule was bipolared and cut out to get further access to the center of the tumor.
Neurology," Working inferiorly and then superiorly, the tumor was taken down off the tentorium as well as out the 9th, 10th or 11th nerve complex."
Neurology, It was very difficult to identify the 7th nerve complex.
Neurology, The brainstem was identified above the complex.
Neurology," Similarly, inferiorly the brainstem was able to be identified and cotton balls were placed to maintain this plain."
Neurology, Attention was then taken to try identify the 7th nerve complex.
Neurology," There were multitude of veins including the lateral pontine vein, which were coming right into this area."
Neurology, The lateral pontine vein was maintained.
Neurology," Microscissors and bipolar were used to develop the plain, and then working inferiorly, the 7th nerve was identified coming off the brainstem."
Neurology, A number 1 and number 2 microinstruments were then used to began to develop the plane.
Neurology, This then allowed for the further appropriate plane medially to be identified and cotton balls were then placed.
Neurology, A number 11 and number 1 microinstrument continued to be used to free up the tumor from the widely spread out 7th nerve.
Neurology, Cavitron was used to debulk the lesion and then further dissection was carried out.
Neurology, The nerve stimulated beautifully at the brainstem level throughout this.
Neurology, The tumor continued to be mobilized off the lateral pontine vein until it was completely off.
Neurology, The Cavitron was used to debulk the lesion out back laterally towards the area of the porus.
Neurology, The tumor was debulked and the capsule continued to be separated with number 11microinstrument as well as the number 1 microinstrument to roll the tumor laterally up towards the porus.
Neurology," At this point, the capsule was so redundant, it was felt to isolate the nerve in the porus."
Neurology, There was minimal bulk remaining intracranially.
Neurology, All the cotton balls were removed and the nerve again stimulated beautifully at the brainstem.
Neurology, Dr. X then came in and scrubbed into the case to drill out the porus and remove the piece of the tumor that was left in the porus and coming out of the porus.
Neurology,", I then scrubbed back into case once Dr. X had completed removing this portion of the tumor."
Neurology, There was no tumor remaining at this point.
Neurology," I placed some Norian in the porus to seal any air cells, although there were no palpated."
Neurology, An intradural space was then irrigated thoroughly.
Neurology, There was no bleeding.
Neurology," The nerve was attempted to be stimulated at the brainstem level, but it did not stimulate at this time."
Neurology, The dura was then closed with 4-0 Nurolons in interrupted fashion.
Neurology, A muscle plug was used over one area.
Neurology, Duragen was laid and strips over the suture line followed by Hemaseel.
Neurology, Gelfoam was set over this and then a titanium cranioplasty was carried out.
Neurology, The wound was then irrigated thoroughly.
Neurology," O Vicryls were used to close the deep muscle and fascia, 3-0 Vicryl for subcutaneous tissue, and 3-0 nylon on the skin."
Neurology,", The patient was extubated and taken to the ICU in stable condition."
Neurology,"CHIEF COMPLAINT: , Severe back pain and sleepiness."

Neurology," He is on Topamax, which is at a moderate dose of 5 mg/kg a day or 50 mg twice a day."
Neurology," At this point, it is not clear whether this medication will protect him or not, but the dose is clearly not at maximum, and he is tolerating the dose currently."
Neurology," The plan will be to increase him up to 50 mg in the morning, and 75 mg at night for 2 weeks, and then 75 mg twice daily."
Neurology," Reviewed the possible side effects of higher doses of Topamax, they will monitor him for language issues, cognitive problems or excessive somnolence."

Neurology," The plan from CT standpoint is to continue stretching program, continue with medical therapy unit."
Neurology," He may benefit from Botox.,"
Neurology,"In addition, I reviewed the Diastat protocol with parents and given the patient tends to go into status epilepticus each time, they can administer Diastat immediately and not wait the standard 2 minutes or even 5 minutes that they were waiting before."
Neurology, They are going to repeat the dose within 10 minutes and they can call EMS at any point during that time.
Neurology," Hopefully at home, they need to start to abort these seizures or the higher dose of Topamax will prevent them."

Neurology," Most recent electroencephalogram still shows abnormalities, but it has not been done since May 2006."
Neurology," The plan at this time is to repeat his electroencephalogram, follow his electroencephalogram annually until it reveres to normal."
Neurology," At that time, he will be tapered off of medication."
Neurology," I anticipate at some point in the near future, within about a year or so, he will actually be taken off medication."
Neurology," For now, I will continue on Trileptal 300 mg twice a day, which is a low starting dose for him."
Neurology, There is no indication that his dose needs to be increased.
Neurology, Family understands the plan.
Neurology, We will try to obtain an electroencephalogram in the near future in Modesto and followup is scheduled for 6 months.
Neurology," Parents will contact us after the electroencephalogram is done so they can get the results., Thank you very much for allowing me to access ABC for further management."
Neurology,"Doctor's Address, Dear Doctor:, This letter serves as a reintroduction of my patient, A, who will be seeing you on Thursday, 06/12/2008."
Neurology," As you know, he is an unfortunate gentleman who has reflex sympathetic dystrophy of both lower extremities."
Neurology, His current symptoms are more severe on the right and he has had a persisting wound that has failed to heal on his right leg.
Neurology," He has been through Wound Clinic to try to help heal this, but was intolerant of compression dressings and was unable to get satisfactory healing of this."
Neurology, He has been seen by Dr. X for his pain management and was considered for the possibility of amputation being a therapeutic option to help reduce his pain.
Neurology, He was seen by Dr. Y at Orthopedic Associates for review of this.
Neurology," However, in my discussion with Dr. Z and his evaluation of Mr. A, it was felt that this may be an imprudent path to take given the lack of likelihood of reduction of his pain from his RST, his questionable healing of his wound given noninvasive studies that did reveal tenuous oxygenation of the right lower leg, and concerns of worsening of his RST symptoms on his left leg if he would have an amputation."
Neurology," Based on the results of his transcutaneous oxygen levels and his dramatic improvement with oxygen therapy at this test, Dr. Z felt that a course of hyperbaric oxygen may be of utility to help in improving his wounds."
Neurology, As you may or may not know we have certainly pursued aggressive significant measures to try to improve Mr. A's pain.
Neurology," He has been to Cleveland Clinic for implantable stimulator, which was unsuccessful at dramatically improving his pain."
Neurology," He currently is taking methadone up to eight tablets four times a day, morphine up to 100 mg three times a day, and Dilaudid two tablets by mouth every two hours to help reduce his pain."
Neurology, He also is currently taking Neurontin 1600
Neurology,"mg three times a day, Effexor XR 250 mg once a day, Cytomel 25 mcg once a day, Seroquel 100 mg p.o. q. day, levothyroxine 300 mcg p.o. q. day, Prinivil 20 mg p.o. q. day, and Mevacor 40 mg p.o. q day."
Neurology,", I appreciate your assistance in determining if hyperbaric oxygen is a reasonable treatment course for this unfortunate situation."
Neurology, Dr. Z
Neurology,and I have both tried to stress the fact that amputation may be an abrupt and irreversible treatment course that may not reach any significant conclusion.
Neurology, He has been evaluated by Dr. X for rehab concerns to determine.
Neurology, He agrees that a less aggressive form of therapy may be most appropriate.
Neurology,", I thank you kindly for your prompt evaluation of this kind gentleman in an unfortunate situation."
Neurology, If you have any questions regarding his care please feel free to call me at my office.
Neurology," Otherwise, I look forward to hearing back from you shortly after your evaluation."
Neurology, Please feel free to call me if it is possible or if you have any questions about anything.
Neurology,"REASON FOR VISIT: , Followup left-sided rotator cuff tear and cervical spinal stenosis., HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , Ms. ABC returns today for followup regarding her left shoulder pain and left upper extremity C6 radiculopathy."
Neurology," I had last seen her on 06/21/07.,"
Neurology,"At that time, she had been referred to me Dr. X and Dr. Y for evaluation of her left-sided C6 radiculopathy."
Neurology," She also had a significant rotator cuff tear and is currently being evaluated for left-sided rotator cuff repair surgery, I believe on, approximately 07/20/07."
Neurology," At our last visit, I only had a report of her prior cervical spine MRI."
Neurology, I did not have any recent images.
Neurology, I referred her for cervical spine MRI and she returns today.
Neurology,", She states that her symptoms are unchanged."
Neurology," She continues to have significant left-sided shoulder pain for which she is being evaluated and is scheduled for surgery with Dr. Y., She also has a second component of pain, which radiates down the left arm in a C6 distribution to the level of the wrist."
Neurology, She has some associated minimal weakness described in detail in our prior office note.
Neurology, No significant right upper extremity symptoms.
Neurology," No bowel, bladder dysfunction."
Neurology," No difficulty with ambulation., FINDINGS: , On examination, she has 4 plus over 5 strength in the left biceps and triceps muscle groups, 4 out of 5 left deltoid, 5 out of 5 otherwise in both muscle groups and all muscle groups of upper extremities."
Neurology," Light touch sensation is minimally decreased in the left C6 distribution; otherwise, intact."
Neurology, Biceps and brachioradialis reflexes are 1 plus.
Neurology, Hoffmann sign normal bilaterally.
Neurology, Motor strength is 5 out of 5 in all muscle groups in lower extremities.
Neurology," Hawkins and Neer impingement signs are positive at the left shoulder., An EMG study performed on 06/08/07 demonstrates no evidence of radiculopathy or plexopathy or nerve entrapment to the left upper extremity."
Neurology,", Cervical spine MRI dated 06/28/07 is reviewed."
Neurology, It is relatively limited study due to artifact.
Neurology, He does demonstrate evidence of minimal-to-moderate stenosis at the C5-C6 level but without evidence of cord impingement or cord signal change.
Neurology," There appears to be left paracentral disc herniation at the C5-C6 level, although axial T2-weighted images are quite limited., ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: , Ms. ABC's history, physical examination and radiographic findings are compatible with left shoulder pain and left upper extremity pain, which is due to a combination of left-sided rotator cuff tear and moderate cervical spinal stenosis."
Neurology,", I agree with the plan to go ahead and continue with rotator cuff surgery."
Neurology," With regard to the radiculopathy, I believe this can be treated non-operatively to begin with."
Neurology, I am referring her for consideration of cervical epidural steroid injections.
Neurology, The improvement in her pain may help her recover better from the shoulder surgery.
Neurology,", I will see her back in followup in 3 months, at which time she will be recovering from a shoulder surgery and we will see if she needs any further intervention with regard to the cervical spine."
Neurology,", I will also be in touch with Dr. Y to let him know this information prior to the surgery in several weeks."
Neurology,"PROCEDURE CODES:  64640 times two, 64614 time two, 95873 times two, 29405 times two., PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  Spastic diplegic cerebral palsy, 343.0., POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  Spastic diplegic cerebral palsy, 343.0., ANESTHESIA:  MAC., COMPLICATIONS:  None., DESCRIPTION OF TECHNIQUE:  Informed consent was obtained from the patient's mom."
Neurology, The patient was brought to minor procedures and sedated per their protocol.
Neurology, The patient was positioned lying supine.
Neurology, Skin overlying all areas injected was prepped with chlorhexidine.
Neurology,", The obturator nerves were identified lateral to the adductor longus tendon origin and below the femoral pulse with active EMG stimulation."
Neurology, Approximately 4 mL of 5% phenol was injected in this location bilaterally.
Neurology, Phenol injections were done at the site of maximum hip adduction contraction with least amount of stimulus.
Neurology," Negative drawback for blood was done prior to each injection of phenol., Muscles injected with botulinum toxin were identified with active EMG stimulation."
Neurology," Approximately 50 units was injected in the rectus femoris bilaterally, 75 units in the medial hamstrings bilaterally and 100 units in the gastrocnemius soleus muscles bilaterally."
Neurology," Total amount of botulinum toxin injected was 450 units diluted 25 units to 1 mL.  After injections were performed, bilateral short leg fiberglass casts were applied."
Neurology, The patient tolerated the procedure well and no complications were encountered.
Neurology,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Large and invasive recurrent pituitary adenoma., POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Large and invasive recurrent pituitary adenoma., OPERATION PERFORMED: , Endoscopic-assisted transsphenoidal exploration and radical excision of pituitary adenoma, endoscopic exposure of sphenoid sinus with removal of tissue from within the sinus, harvesting of dermal fascia abdominal fat graft, placement of abdominal fat graft into sella turcica, reconstruction of sellar floor using autologous nasal bone creating a cranioplasty of less than 5 cm, repair of nasal septal deviation, using the operating microscope and microdissection technique, and placement of lumbar subarachnoid catheter connected to reservoir for aspiration and infusion., INDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURE: , This man has undergone one craniotomy and 2 previous transsphenoidal resections of his tumor, which is known to be an invasive pituitary adenoma."
Neurology," He did not return for followup or radiotherapy as instructed, and the tumor has regrown."
Neurology," For this reason, he is admitted for transsphenoidal reoperation with an attempt to remove as much tumor as possible."
Neurology, The high-risk nature of the procedure and the fact that postoperative radiation is mandatory was made clear to him.
Neurology, Many risks including CSF leak and blindness were discussed in detail.
Neurology," After clear understanding of all the same, he elected to proceed ahead with surgery., PROCEDURE:  , The patient was placed on the operating table, and after adequate induction of general anesthesia, he was placed in the left lateral decubitus position."
Neurology, Care was taken to pad all pressure points appropriately.
Neurology, The back was prepped and draped in usual sterile manner.
Neurology,", A 14-gauge Tuohy needle was introduced into the lumbar subarachnoid space."
Neurology, Clear and colorless CSF issued forth.
Neurology," A catheter was inserted to a distance of 40 cm, and the needle was removed."
Neurology, The catheter was then connected to a closed drainage system for aspiration and infusion.
Neurology,", This no-touch technique is now a standard of care for treatment of patients with large invasive adenomas."
Neurology," Via injections through the lumbar drain, one increases intracranial pressure and produces gentle migration of the tumor."
Neurology, This improves outcome and reduces complications by atraumatically dissecting the tumor away from the optic apparatus.
Neurology,", The patient was then placed supine, and the 3-point headrest was affixed."
Neurology, He was placed in the semi-sitting position with the head turned to the right and a roll placed under the left shoulder.
Neurology, Care was taken to pad all pressure points appropriately.
Neurology, The fluoroscope C-arm unit was then positioned so as to afford an excellent view of the sella and sphenoid sinus in the lateral projection.
Neurology, The metallic arm was then connected to the table for the use of the endoscope.
Neurology," The oropharynx, nasopharynx, and abdominal areas were then prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner."
Neurology,","
Neurology,"A transverse incision was made in the abdominal region, and several large pieces of fat were harvested for later use."
Neurology, Hemostasis was obtained.
Neurology, The wound was carefully closed in layers.
Neurology,", I then advanced a 0-degree endoscope up the left nostril."
Neurology, The middle turbinate was identified and reflected laterally exposing the sphenoid sinus ostium.
Neurology, Needle Bovie electrocautery was used to clear mucosa away from the ostium.
Neurology, The perpendicular plate of the ethmoid had already been separated from the sphenoid.
Neurology, I entered into the sphenoid.
Neurology,", There was a tremendous amount of dense fibrous scar tissue present, and I slowly and carefully worked through all this."
Neurology," I identified a previous sellar opening and widely opened the bone, which had largely regrown out to the cavernous sinus laterally on the left, which was very well exposed, and the cavernous sinus on the right, which I exposed the very medial portion of."
Neurology, The opening was wide until I had the horizontal portion of the floor to the tuberculum sella present.
Neurology,", The operating microscope was then utilized."
Neurology," Working under magnification, I used hypophysectomy placed in the nostril.,"
Neurology,"The dura was then carefully opened in the midline, and I immediately encountered tissue consistent with pituitary adenoma."
Neurology," A frozen section was obtained, which confirmed this diagnosis without malignant features., Slowly and meticulously, I worked to remove the tumor."
Neurology, I used the suction apparatus as well as the bipolar coagulating forceps and ring and cup curette to begin to dissect tumor free.
Neurology," The tumor was moderately vascular and very fibrotic., Slowly and carefully, I systematically entered the sellar contents until I could see the cavernous sinus wall on the left and on the right."
Neurology, There appeared to be cavernous sinus invasion on the left.
Neurology, It was consistent with what we saw on the MRI imaging.
Neurology,", The portion working into the suprasellar cistern was slowly dissected down by injecting saline into the lumbar subarachnoid catheter."
Neurology, A large amount of this was removed.
Neurology," There was a CSF leak, as the tumor was removed for the upper surface of it was very adherent to the arachnoid and could not be separated free.,"
Neurology,"Under high magnification, I actually worked up into this cavity and performed a very radical excision of tumor."
Neurology," While there may be a small amount of tumor remaining, it appeared that a radical excision had been created with decompression of the optic apparatus."
Neurology," In fact, I reinserted the endoscope and could see the optic chiasm well."
Neurology,", I reasoned that I had therefore achieved the goal with that is of a radical excision and decompression."
Neurology, Attention was therefore turned to closure.
Neurology,", The wound was copiously irrigated with Bacitracin solution, and meticulous hemostasis was obtained."
Neurology," I asked Anesthesiology to perform a Valsalva maneuver, and there was no evidence of bleeding.,"
Neurology,Attention was turned to closure and reconstruction.
Neurology, I placed a very large piece of fat in the sella to seal the leak and verified that there was no fat in the suprasellar cistern by using fluoroscopy and looking at the pattern of the air.
Neurology," Using a polypropylene insert, I reconstructed the sellar floor with this implant making a nice tight sling and creating a cranioplasty of less than 5 cm., DuraSeal was placed over this, and the sphenoid sinus was carefully packed with fat and DuraSeal., I inspected the nasal passages and restored the septum precisely to the midline repairing a previous septal deviation."
Neurology, The middle turbinates were then restored to their anatomic position.
Neurology," There was no significant intranasal bleeding, and for this reason, an open nasal packing was required."
Neurology," Sterile dressings were applied, and the operation was terminated., The patient tolerated the procedure well and left to the recovery room in excellent condition."
Neurology," The sponge and needle counts were reported as correct, and there were no intraoperative complications., Specimens were sent to Pathology consisting of tumor."
Neurology,"PROCEDURES PERFORMED: , Phenol neurolysis right obturator nerve, botulinum toxin injection right rectus femoris and vastus medialis intermedius and"

Neurology, She was brought to the minor procedure area and sedated per their protocol.
Neurology, The patient was positioned lying supine.
Neurology, Skin overlying all areas injected was prepped with chlorhexidine.
Neurology, The right obturator nerve was identified using active EMG stimulation lateral to the adductor longus tendon origin and below the femoral pulse.
Neurology, Approximately 6 mL of 5% phenol was injected in this location.
Neurology," At all sites of phenol injections, injections were done at the site of maximum hip adduction contraction with least amount of stimulus."
Neurology," Negative drawback for blood was done prior to each injection of phenol., Muscles injected with botulinum toxin were identified with active EMG stimulation."
Neurology, Approximately 100 units was injected in the right pectoralis major and 100 units in the right rectus femoris and vastus intermedius muscles.
Neurology, Total amount of botulinum toxin injected was 200 units diluted 25 units to 1 mL.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and no complications were encountered.
Neurology,"DIAGNOSIS:,  Status post brain tumor removal., HISTORY:,  The patient is a 64-year-old female referred to physical therapy following complications related to brain tumor removal."
Neurology, The patient reports that on 10/24/08 she had a brain tumor removed and had left-sided weakness.
Neurology, The patient was being seen in physical therapy from 11/05/08 to 11/14/08 then she began having complications.
Neurology, The patient reports that she was admitted to Hospital on 12/05/08.
Neurology," At that time, they found massive swelling on the brain and a second surgery was performed."
Neurology, The patient then remained in acute rehab until she was discharged to home on 01/05/09.
Neurology," The patient's husband, Al, is also present and he reports that during rehabilitation the patient did have a DVT in the left calf that has since been resolved.,"
Neurology,"PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: , Unremarkable., MEDICATIONS:  , Coumadin, Keppra, Decadron, and Glucophage., SUBJECTIVE: , The patient reports that the pain is not an issue at this time."

Neurology,"XYZ Street, City, State, Dear Dr. CD:, Thank you for seeing Mr. XYZ, a pleasant 19-year-old male who has seen you in 2005 for suspected seizure activity."
Neurology, He comes to my office today continuing on Dilantin 300 mg daily and has been seizure episode free for the past 2 1/2 years.
Neurology, He is requesting to come off the Dilantin at this point.
Neurology, Upon reviewing your 2005 note there was some discrepancy as to the true nature of his episodes to the emergency room and there was consideration to reconsider medication use.
Neurology," His physical exam, neurologically, is normal at this time."
Neurology, His Dilantin level is slightly low at 12.5.
Neurology,", I will appreciate your evaluation and recommendation as to whether we need to continue the Dilantin at this time."
Neurology, I understand this will probably entail repeating his EEG and so please coordinate this through Health Center.
Neurology, I await your response and whether we should continue this medication.
Neurology," If you require any laboratory, we use ABC Diagnostic and any further testing that is needed should be coordinated at Health Center prior to scheduling."
Neurology,"REASON FOR VISIT:  , The patient is a 38-year-old woman with pseudotumor cerebri without papilledema who comes in because of new onset of headaches."
Neurology," She comes to clinic by herself., HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , Dr. X has cared for her since 2002."
Neurology, She has a Codman-Hakim shunt set at 90 mmH2O.  She last saw us in clinic in January 2008 and at that time we recommended that she followup with Dr. Y for medical management of her chronic headaches.
Neurology," We also recommended that the patient see a psychiatrist regarding her depression, which she stated that she would followup with that herself."
Neurology," Today, the patient returns to clinic because of acute onset of headaches that she has had since her shunt was adjusted after an MRI on 04/18/08."
Neurology, She states that since that time her headaches have been bad.
Neurology, They woke her up at night.
Neurology, She has not been able to sleep.
Neurology, She has not had a good sleep cycle since that time.
Neurology," She states that the pain is constant and is worse with coughing, straining, and sneezing as well as on standing up."
Neurology, She states that they feel a little bit better when lying down.
Neurology, Medication shave not helped her.
Neurology," She has tried taking Imitrex as well as Motrin 800 mg twice a day, but she states it has not provided much relief."
Neurology," The pain is generalized, but also noted to be quite intense in the frontal region of her head."
Neurology, She also reports ringing in the ears and states that she just does not feel well.
Neurology, She reports no nausea at this time.
Neurology, She also states that she has been experiencing intermittent blurry vision and dimming lights as well.
Neurology, She tells me that she has an appointment with Dr. Y tomorrow.

Neurology," It looks like there is a little bit of dry blood there., ASSESSMENT:,  The patient appears to have had worsening headaches since shunt adjustment back after an MRI., PROBLEMS/DIAGNOSES:, 1."
Neurology," Pseudotumor cerebri without papilledema., 2."
Neurology," Migraine headaches., PROCEDURES:,  I programmed her shunt to 90 mmH2O., PLAN:,  It was noted that the patient began to have an acute onset of headache pain after her shunt adjustment approximately a week and a half ago."
Neurology, I had programmed her shunt back to 90 mmH2O at that time and confirmed it with an x-ray.
Neurology," However, the picture of the x-ray was not the most desirable picture."
Neurology," Thus, I decided to reprogram the shunt back to 90 mmH2O today and have the patient return to Sinai for a skull x-ray to confirm the setting at 90."
Neurology," In addition, she told me that she is scheduled to see Dr. Y tomorrow, so she should followup with him and also plan on contacting the Wilmer Eye Institute to setup an appointment."

Neurology,"EXAM: , Cervical, lumbosacral, thoracic spine flexion and extension., HISTORY: , Back and neck pain., CERVICAL SPINE, FINDINGS:  , AP, lateral with flexion and extension, and both oblique projections of the cervical spine demonstrate alignment and soft tissue structures to be unremarkable."
Neurology,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Squamous cell carcinoma of right temporal bone/middle ear space., POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Squamous cell carcinoma of right temporal bone/middle ear space., PROCEDURE: ,"
Neurology,"Right temporal bone resection; rectus abdominis myocutaneous free flap for reconstruction of skull base defect; right selective neck dissection zones 2 and 3., ANESTHESIA: , General endotracheal., DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  , The patient was brought into the operating room, placed on the table in supine position."
Neurology, General endotracheal anesthesia was obtained in the usual fashion.
Neurology, The Neurosurgery team placed the patient in pins and after they positioned the patient the right lateral scalp was prepped with Betadine after shave as well as the abdomen.
Neurology, The neck was prepped as well.
Neurology," After this was performed, I made a wide ellipse of the conchal bowl with the Bovie and cutting current down through the cartilage of the conchal bowl."
Neurology, A wide postauricular incision well beyond the mastoid tip extending into the right neck was then incised with the Bovie with the cutting current and a postauricular skin flap developed leaving the excise conchal bowl in place as the auricle was reflected over anterior to the condyle.
Neurology," After this was performed, I used the Bovie to incise the soft tissue around the temporal bone away from the tumor on to the mandible."
Neurology, The condyle was skeletonized so that it could be easily seen.
Neurology, The anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid was dissected out and the spinal accessory nerve was identified and spared.
Neurology, The neck contents to the hyoid were dissected out.
Neurology," The hypoglossal nerve, vagus nerve, and spinal accessory nerve were dissected towards the jugular foramen."
Neurology, The neck contents were removed as a separate specimen.
Neurology, The external carotid artery was identified and tied off as it entered the parotid and tied with a Hemoclip distally for the future anastomosis.
Neurology, A large posterior facial vein was identified and likewise clipped for later use.
Neurology," I then used the cutting and diamond burs to incise the skull above the external auditory canal so as to expose the dura underneath this and extended it posteriorly to the sigmoid sinus, dissecting or exposing the dura to the level of the jugular bulb."
Neurology," It became evident there was two tumor extending down the eustachian tube medial to the condyle and therefore I did use the router, I mean the side cutting bur to resect the condyle and the glenoid fossa to expose the medial extent of the eustachian tube."
Neurology, The internal carotid artery was dissected out of the parapharyngeal space into the carotid canal and I drilled carotid canal up until it made.
Neurology, I dissected the vertical segment of the carotid out as it entered the temporal bone until it made us turn to the horizontal portion.
Neurology," Once this was dissected out, Dr. X entered the procedure for completion of the resection with the craniotomy."
Neurology," For details, please see his operative note.,"
Neurology,"After Dr. X had completed the resection, I then harvested the rectus free flap."
Neurology, A skin paddle was drawn out next to the umbilicus about 4 x 4 cm.
Neurology, The skin paddle was incised with the Bovie and down to the anterior rectus sheath.
Neurology, Sagittal incisions were made up superiorly and inferiorly to the skin paddle and the anterior rectus sheath dissected out above and below the skin paddle.
Neurology, The sheath was incised to the midline and a small ellipse was made around the fascia to provide blood supply to the overlying skin.
Neurology, The skin paddle was then sutured to the fascia and muscle with interrupted 3-0 Vicryl.
Neurology," The anterior rectus sheath was then reflected off the rectus muscle, which was then divided superiorly with the Bovie and reflected out of the rectus sheath to an inferior direction."
Neurology, The vascular pedicle could be seen entering the muscle in usual fashion.
Neurology, The muscle was divided inferior to the pedicle and then the pedicle was dissected to the groin to the external iliac artery and vein where it was ligated with two large Hemoclips on each vessel.
Neurology, The wound was then packed with saline impregnated sponges.
Neurology, The rectus muscle with attached skin paddle was then transferred into the neck.
Neurology, The inferior epigastric artery was sutured to the end of the external carotid with interrupted 9-0 Ethilon with standard microvascular technique.
Neurology, Ischemia time was less than 10 minutes.
Neurology," Likewise, the inferior epigastric vein was sutured to the end of the posterior facial vein with interrupted 9-0 Ethilon as well."
Neurology, There was excellent blood flow through the flap and there were no or any issues with the vascular pedicle throughout the remainder of the case.
Neurology, The wound was irrigated with copious amounts of saline.
Neurology, The eustachian tube was obstructed with bone wax.
Neurology, The muscle was then laid into position with the skin paddle underneath the conchal bowl.
Neurology, I removed most the skin of the conchal bowl de-epithelializing and leaving the fat in place.
Neurology," The wound was closed in layers overlying the muscle, which was secured superiorly to the muscle overlying the temporal skull."
Neurology, The subcutaneous tissues were closed with interrupted 3-0 Vicryl.
Neurology, The skin was closed with skin staples.
Neurology, There was small incision made in the postauricular skin where the muscle could be seen and the skin edges were sewn directly to the muscle as to the rectus muscle itself.
Neurology, The skin paddle was closed with interrupted 4-0 Prolene to the edges of the conchal bowl.
Neurology,", The abdomen was irrigated with copious amounts of saline and the rectus sheath was closed with #1 Prolene with the more running suture, taking care to avoid injury to the posterior rectus sheath by the use of ribbon retractors."
Neurology, The subcutaneous tissues were closed with interrupted 2-0 Vicryl and skin was closed with skin staples.
Neurology, The patient was then turned over to the Neurosurgery team for awakening after the patient was appropriately awakened.
Neurology," The patient was then transferred to the PACU in stable condition with spontaneous respirations, having tolerated the procedure well."
Neurology,"REASON FOR REFERRAL:,  The patient is a 58-year-old African-American right-handed female with 16 years of education who was referred for a neuropsychological evaluation by Dr. X."
Neurology,"She is presenting for a second opinion following a recent neuropsychological evaluation that was ordered by her former place of employment that suggested that she was in the ""early stages of a likely dementia"" and was thereafter terminated from her position as a psychiatric nurse."

Neurology," To summarize, the results indicated ""diagnostically, The patient presents cognitive deficits involving visual working memory, executive functioning, and motor functioning along with low average intellectual functioning that is significantly below her memory functioning and below expectation based on her occupational and academic history."
Neurology," This suggests that her intellectual functioning has declined."""
Neurology," It concluded that ""results overall suggest early stages of a likely dementia or possibly the effects of diabetes, although her deficits are greater than expected for diabetes-related executive functioning problems and peripheral neuropathy…  The patient' deficits within the current test battery suggest that she would not be able to safely and effectively perform the duties of a nurse supervisor without help handling documentary demands and some supervision of her visual processing."
Neurology," The prognosis for improvement is not good, although she might try stimulant medication if compatible with her other."
Neurology," Following her dismissal, The patient presented to her primary physician, Henry Fein, M.D., who referred her to Dr. X for a second opinion regarding her cognitive deficits."

Neurology, Joint position sense was absent in the toes and severely decreased in the fingers.
Neurology, Pin perception was absent in the feet and was decreased to the upper thighs.
Neurology, Pin was decreased or absent in the fingers and decreased above the elbows.
Neurology," The same distribution of sensory loss was found with monofilament testing., COORDINATION:  Coordination was barely normal in the right hand."
Neurology, Rapid alternating movements were decreased in the left hand greater than the right hand.
Neurology," The patient was unable to stand and therefore gait, Romberg's test and balance could not be assessed., DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES: , Previous diagnostic studies and patient reports."
Neurology," There were extensive patient reports, all of which were reviewed."
Neurology, A previous x-ray study of the lateral chest performed in October 2008 showed poor inspiration with basilar atelectasis and an infiltrate.
Neurology," An x-ray of the cervical, thoracic and lumbar spine showed some evidence of lumbar spinal stenosis."
Neurology," A CTA of the neck with and without contrast performed in November 2008 showed minor stenosis in the left carotid, a mild hard and soft plaque in the right carotid with approximately 55% stenosis."
Neurology, The posterior circulation showed a slightly dominant right vertebral artery with no stenosis.
Neurology," There was no significant stenosis, but there was minor extracranial stenosis noted."
Neurology," An MRI of the brain with and without contrast performed in November 2008 showed no evidence of an acute infarct, major vascular occlusion, and no abnormal enhancement with gadolinium administration."
Neurology, There was also no significant sinusitis or mastoiditis.
Neurology, This was an essentially normal brain MRI.
Neurology," A CBC performed in January 2009 showed an elevated white cell count of 11.3, a low red cell count of 3.43, elevated MCH of 32.4 and the rest of the study was normal."
Neurology," An electrolyte study performed in January 2009 showed a sodium which was low at 127, a calcium which was low at 8.3, and a low protein of 5.2 and albumin of 3.1."
Neurology, The glucose was 86.
Neurology," TSH performed in January 2009 was 1.57, which is within the normal range."
Neurology," Vitamin B12 was greater than a 1000, which is normal and the folate was 18.2, which was normal."
Neurology, A myocardial stress study performed in December 2008 showed normal myocardial perfusion with Persantine Cardiolite SPECT.
Neurology, The ECG was non-diagnostic.
Neurology, There was normal regional wall motion of the left ventricle.
Neurology," The left ventricular ejection fraction was 68%, which is within the normal range for males."
Neurology," A CT of the lumbar spine without contrast performed in December 2008 showed a broad-based disc bulge at L1-L2, L2-L3, L3-L4 and L4-L5."
Neurology," At L5-S1, in addition to the broad-based disc bulge, there was also an osteophyte complex and evidence of flavum hypertrophy without canal stenosis."
Neurology, There was severe bilateral neural foraminal stenosis at L5-S1 and moderate neural foraminal stenosis at L1-L4.
Neurology," An echocardiogram was performed in November 2008 and showed mild left atrial enlargement, normal left ventricular systolic function, mild concentric left ventricular hypertrophy, scleral degenerative changes in the aortic and mitral apparatus, mild mitral regurgitation, mild tricuspid regurgitation and mild to moderate aortic regurgitation."
Neurology,", DIAGNOSTIC IMPRESSION:  , The patient presents with a severe neuropathy with marked large fiber sensory as well as motor findings."
Neurology," He is diffusely weak as well as atrophic in all muscle groups both in his upper and lower extremities, although he is disproportionately weak in his lower extremities."
Neurology," His proprioceptive and vibratory loss is severe in both the distal upper and lower extremities, signifying that he either has a severe sensory neuropathy or has involvement of the dorsal root ganglia."
Neurology," According to the history, which was carefully checked, the initial onset of these symptoms goes back one and a half years, although there has only been significant progression in his condition since July 2008."
Neurology," As indicated below, further diagnostic studies including a detailed nerve conduction and EMG test today showed evidence of a severe sensory, motor, and axonal neuropathy and in addition there was evidence of a diffuse polyradiculopathy."
Neurology, There was no involvement of the tongue on EMG.
Neurology, The laboratory testing as indicated below failed to show a specific cause for the neuropathy.
Neurology," We are still, however, waiting for the paraneoplastic antibodies, which were send out lab to the Mayo Clinic."
Neurology," This type of very severe sensorimotor neuropathy with significant proprioceptive loss may be seen in several conditions including peripheral nerve vasculitis due to a variety of disorders such as SLE, Sjogren's, rheumatoid arthritis, and mixed connective tissue disease."
Neurology," In addition, it may also be seen with certain toxins, particularly chemotherapeutic agents."
Neurology, The patient did not receive any of these.
Neurology, It may also be seen as part of a paraneoplastic syndrome.
Neurology," Although the patient does not have any specific clinical symptoms of a cancer, it is noted that he has had an 18-pound weight loss in the past month and does have a remote history of smoking."
Neurology," We have requested that he obtain a CT of his chest, abdomen and pelvis while he is in Acute Rehabilitation."
Neurology, The verbal reports of these possibly did not show any evidence of a cancer.
Neurology, We did also request that he obtain a gallium scan to see if there was any evidence of an unsuspected neoplasm.
Neurology," The patient did undergo a nerve and muscle biopsy, this was a radial nerve and biceps muscle biopsy from the left arm."
Neurology, This showed evidence of severe axonal loss.
Neurology, There was no evidence of a vasculitis.
Neurology, The vessels did show some mild intimal changes that would be consistent with atherosclerosis.
Neurology," There were a few perivascular changes; however, there was no clear evidence of a necrotizing vasculitis even on multiple sections."
Neurology," The muscle biopsy showed severe muscle fiber atrophy, with evidence of fiber grouping."
Neurology," Again, there was no evidence of inflammation or vasculitis."
Neurology," Evaluation so far has also shown no evidence of an amyloid neuropathy, no evidence of a monoclonal gammopathy, of sarcoidosis, and again there is no past history of a significant toxin or infective cause for the neuropathy."
Neurology," Specifically, there is no history of HIV exposure."
Neurology, We would await the results of the gallium scan and of the paraneoplastic antibodies to see if these are helpful in making a diagnosis.
Neurology," At this point, because of the severity and the axonal nature of the neuropathy, there is no specific therapy that will reverse the course of the illness, unless we find a specific etiology that can be stopped or reversed."
Neurology, I have discussed these issues at length with the patient and with his son.
Neurology, We also addressed whether or not there might be a previously undiagnosed inherited neuropathy.
Neurology, I think this is unlikely given the short history and the rapid progression of the disorder.
Neurology,","
Neurology,"There is also no family history that we can detect a neuropathy, and the patient does not have the typical phenotype for a chronic inherited neuropathy such as Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2."
Neurology," However, since I have only seen the patient on one occasion and do not know what his previous examination showed two years ago, I cannot be certain that there may not have been the presence of a neuropathy preceding this., PLAN:, 1."
Neurology, Nerve conduction and EMG will be performed today.
Neurology," The results were indicated above., 2."
Neurology," The following laboratory studies were requested including electrolytes, CBC, thyroid function tests, B12, ANA, C-reactive protein, complement, cryoglobulins, double-stranded DNA antibodies, folate level, hemoglobin A1c, immunofixation electrophoresis, P-ANCA, C-ANCA, protein electrophoresis, rheumatoid factor, paraneoplastic antibody studies requested from the Mayo Clinic, B12."
Neurology," These studies showed minor changes, which included a low sodium level of 129 as previously noted, a low creatinine of 0.74, low calcium of 8.6, low total protein of 5.7."
Neurology, The B12 was greater than 2000.
Neurology," The immunoelectrophoresis, ANA, double-stranded DNA, ANCA, hemoglobin A1c, folate, cryoglobulins, complement, C-reactive protein were all normal or negative."
Neurology, The B12 level was greater than 2000.

Neurology, Oxycodone helps somewhat and gives him at least three hours pain relief.
Neurology," Because of the pain, he has significant problems with fractured sleep."
Neurology, He states he has not had a good night's sleep in many years.
Neurology," About six months ago, after an MI and pacemaker insertion, he was transferred to a nursing facility."
Neurology," At that facility, his insulin was stopped."
Neurology, Since then he has only been on oral medication for his diabetes.

Neurology, Probable painful diabetic neuropathy.
Neurology," Symptoms are predominantly sensory and severely dysfunctioning, with the patient having inability to ambulate independently as well as difficulty with grip and temperature differentiation in his upper extremities."
Neurology, He has relative preservation of motor function.
Neurology," Because these symptoms are progressive and, by report, he came off his insulin, suggesting somewhat mild diabetes, I would like to rule out other causes of progressive neuropathy., 2."
Neurology, He has history of myoclonic jerks.
Neurology," I did not see any on my examination today and I feel that these are benign and probably secondary to his severe insomnia, which he states is secondary to the painful neuropathy."
Neurology, I would like to rule out other causes such as hepatic encephalopathy.
Neurology,", , I have recommended the following:, 1."

Neurology, She has had some immigration problems in recent months and has experienced increased frequency of her migraine symptoms.
Neurology, Her diagnosis is consistent with vestibular migraine.
Neurology," I do not see evidence of multiple sclerosis, Ménière's disease, or benign paroxysmal positional vertigo."
Neurology,", I talked to her in detail about the importance of following a migraine diet."
Neurology," I gave her instructions including a list of foods times, which worsen migraine."
Neurology, I reviewed this information for more than half the clinic visit.
Neurology, I would like to start her on amitriptyline at a dose of 10 mg at time.
Neurology, She will take Motrin at a dose of 800 mg as needed for her severe headaches.
Neurology,", She will make a diary of her migraine symptoms so that we can find any triggering food items, which worsen her symptoms."
Neurology," I encouraged her to walk daily in order to improve her fitness, which helps to reduce migraine symptoms."
Neurology,"REASON FOR CONSULTATION: , Neurologic consultation was requested by Dr. X to evaluate her seizure medication and lethargy., HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , The patient is well known to me."

Neurology," This past Friday, she had a 25-minute seizure reportedly."
Neurology," This consisted of eye deviation, unresponsiveness, and posturing."
Neurology, Diastat was used and which mom perceived was effective.
Neurology," Her Trileptal dose was increased to 3 mL b.i.d. yesterday.,"
Neurology,"According to mom since her shunt revision on 12/18/2007, she has been sleepier than normal."
Neurology," She appeared to be stable until this past Monday about six days ago, she became more lethargic and had episodes of vomiting and low-grade fevers."
Neurology," According to mom, she had stopped vomiting since her hospitalization."
Neurology," Reportedly, she was given a medication in the emergency room."

Neurology, Bilateral lower extremity spasticity was noted.
Neurology, There was increased flexor tone in the right upper extremity.
Neurology," IV was noted on the left hand., ASSESSMENT:  , Seizure breakthrough due to intercurrent febrile illness."
Neurology, Her lethargy could be secondary to a viral illness with some component of medication effect since her Trileptal dose was increased yesterday and these are probable explanations if indeed shunt malfunction has been excluded.
Neurology,", I concur with Dr. X's recommendations."
Neurology, I do not recommend any changes in Trileptal for now.

Neurology,"REASON FOR VISIT:  , The patient is a 76-year-old man referred for neurological consultation by Dr. X.  The patient is companied to clinic today by his wife and daughter."
Neurology," He provides a small portion of his history; however, his family provides virtually all of it., HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , He has trouble with walking and balance, with bladder control, and with thinking and memory."
Neurology," When I asked him to provide me detail, he could not tell me much more than the fact that he has trouble with his walking and that he has trouble with his bladder."
Neurology," He is vaguely aware that he has trouble with his memory.,"
Neurology,"According to his family, he has had difficulty with his gait for at least three or four years."
Neurology," At first, they thought it was weakness and because of he was on the ground (for example, gardening) he was not able to get up by himself."
Neurology," They did try stopping the statin that he was taking at that time, but because there was no improvement over two weeks, they resumed the statin."
Neurology," As time progressed, he developed more and more difficulty."
Neurology, He started to shuffle.
Neurology, He started using a cane about two and a half years ago and has used a walker with wheels in the front since July of 2006.
Neurology," At this point, he frequently if not always has trouble getting in or out of the seat."
Neurology, He frequently tends to lean backwards or sideways when sitting.
Neurology," He frequently if not always has trouble getting in or out a car, always shuffles or scuffs his feet, always has trouble turning or changing direction, always has trouble with uneven surfaces or curbs, and always has to hold on to someone or something when walking."

Neurology," He has no stairs in his home, however, his family indicates that he would not be able to take stairs."
Neurology, His handwriting has become smaller and shakier.
Neurology,", In regard to the bladder, he states, ""I wet the bed."""
Neurology," In talking with his family, it seems as if he has no warning that he needs to empty his bladder."
Neurology, He was diagnosed with a small bladder tumor in 2005.
Neurology, This was treated by Dr. Y.  Dr. X does not think that the bladder tumor has anything to do with the patient's urinary incontinence.
Neurology, The patient has worn a pad or undergarment for at least one to one and a half years.
Neurology, His wife states that they go through two or three of them per day.
Neurology," He has been placed on medications; however, they have not helped."
Neurology,", He has no headaches or sensation of head fullness."
Neurology,","
Neurology,"In regard to the thinking and memory, at first he seemed forgetful and had trouble with dates."
Neurology, Now he seems less spontaneous and his family states he seems to have trouble expressing himself.
Neurology, His wife took over his medications about two years ago.
Neurology, She stopped his driving about three years ago.
Neurology, She discovered that his license had been expired for about a year and she was concerned enough at that time that she told him he could drive no more.
Neurology," Apparently, he did not object."
Neurology," At this point, he frequently has trouble with memory, orientation, and everyday problems solving at home."

Neurology,10/27/94 and 10/31/94 CSF cultures taken from the cervical region eventually grew non-encapsulated crytococcus neoformans.
Neurology,The patient was treated with amphotericin and showed some improvement.
Neurology,"However, scarring had probably occurred by then and the V-P shunt was left in place."
Neurology,"REASON FOR VISIT: , This is a new patient evaluation for Mr. A."
Neurology,There is a malignant meningioma.
Neurology," He is referred by Dr. X., HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , He said he has had two surgeries in 07/06 followed by radiation and then again in 08/07."
Neurology," He then had a problem with seizures, hemiparesis, has been to the hospital, developed C-diff, and is in the nursing home currently."
Neurology, He is unable to stand at the moment.
Neurology, He is unable to care for himself.
Neurology,", I reviewed the information that was sent down with him from the nursing home which includes his medical history., MEDICATIONS:  , Keppra 1500 twice a day and Decadron 6 mg four times a day."

Neurology, He has an expressive dysphasia and confusion.
Neurology,", I reviewed the imaging studies from summer from the beginning of 10/07, end of 10/07 as well as the current MRI he had last week."
Neurology, This shows that he has had progression of disease with recurrence along the surface of the brain and there is significant brain edema.
Neurology," This is a malignant meningioma by diagnosis., ASSESSMENT/PLAN: , In summary, Mr. A has significant disability and is not independent currently."
Neurology, I believe that because of this that the likelihood of benefit from surgery is small and there is a very good chance that he would not be able to recover from surgery.
Neurology, I do not think that surgery will help his quality of life and a need to control the tumor would be dependent on another therapy impacting the tumor.
Neurology," Given that there are not good therapies and chemotherapy would be the option at the moment, and he certainly is not in a condition where chemotherapy would be given, I believe that surgery would not be in his best interest."
Neurology," I discussed this both with him, although it is not clear to me how much he understood, as well as his family."

Neurology,"HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , The patient is a 35-year-old woman who reports that on the 30th of October 2008, she had a rupture of her membranes at nine months of pregnancy, and was admitted to hospital and was given an epidural anesthetic."
Neurology," I do not have the records from this hospital admission, but apparently the epidural was administered for approximately 14 to 18 hours."
Neurology, She was sitting up during the epidural.
Neurology,", She did not notice any difference in her lower extremities at the time she had the epidural; however, she reports that she was extremely sleepy and may not have been aware of any change in strength or sensation in her lower extremities at that time."
Neurology," She delivered on the 31st of October, by Cesarean section, because she had failed to progress and had pyrexia."
Neurology,", She also had a Foley catheter placed at that time."
Neurology," On the 1st of November 2008, they began to mobilize her and it was at that time that she first noticed that she could not walk."
Neurology," She was aware that she could not move her legs at all, and then within a few days, she was aware that she could move toes in the left foot but could not move her right foot at all."
Neurology," Since that time, there has been a gradual improvement in strength to the point that she now has limited movement in her left leg and severely restricted movement in her right leg."
Neurology," She is not able to walk by herself, and needs assistance to stand."
Neurology, She was discharged from hospital after the Cesarean section on the 3rd of November.
Neurology," Unfortunately, we do not have the records and we do not know what the discussion was between the anesthesiologist and the patient at the time of discharge."
Neurology," She was then seen at ABC Hospital on November 05, 2008."
Neurology," She had an MRI scan of her spine, which showed no evidence of an abnormality, specifically there were no cord changes and no evidence of a hematoma."
Neurology," She also had an EMG study at that time by Dr. X, which was abnormal but not diagnostic and this was repeated again in December."
Neurology," At the present time, she also complains of a pressure in both her legs and in her thighs."
Neurology, She complains that her right foot hurts and that she has some hyperesthesia there.
Neurology," She has been taking gabapentin to try to reduce the discomfort, although she is on a very low dose and the effect is minimal."

Neurology," In the lower extremities, they were 0 bilaterally at the knee and ankles."
Neurology, The abdominal reflexes were present above the umbilicus and absent below the umbilicus.
Neurology, The plantar responses were mute.
Neurology," The jaw reflex was normal., SENSATION:"
Neurology, Vibration was moderately decreased in the right great toe and was mildly decreased in the left great toe.
Neurology, There was a sensory level to light touch at approximately T7 posteriorly and approximately T9 anteriorly.
Neurology," There was a range of sensation, but clearly there was a decrease in sensation below this level but not complete loss of sensation."
Neurology," To pain, the sensory level is even less clear, but appeared to be at about T7 on the right side."
Neurology," In the lower extremities, there was a slight decrease in pin and light touch in the right great toe compared to the left."
Neurology, There was no evidence of allodynia or hyperesthesia.
Neurology," Joint position sense was mildly reduced in the right toe and normal on the left., COORDINATION:  Coordination for rapid alternating movements and finger-to-nose testing was normal."
Neurology," Coordination could not be tested in the lower extremities., GAIT:  The patient was unable to stand and therefore we were unable to test gait or Romberg's."
Neurology, There was no evidence of focal back tenderness.
Neurology,", REVIEW OF OUTSIDE RECORDS: , I have reviewed the records from ABC Hospital, including the letter from Dr. Y and the EMG report dated 12/17/2008 from Dr. X."
Neurology,The EMG report shows evidence of a lumbosacral polyradiculopathy below approximately T6.
Neurology," The lower extremity sensory responses are essentially normal; however, there is a decrease in the amplitude of the motor responses with minimal changes in latency."
Neurology, I do have the MRI of lumbar spine report from 11/06/2008 with and without contrast.
Neurology," This showed a minimal concentric disc bulge of L4-L5 without disc herniation, but was otherwise unremarkable."
Neurology," The patient brought a disc with a most recent MRI study; however, we were unable to open this on our computers."
Neurology, The verbal report is that the study was unremarkable except for some gadolinium enhancement in the lumbar nerve roots.
Neurology, A Doppler of the lower extremities showed no evidence of deep venous thrombosis in either lower extremity.
Neurology," Chest x-ray showed some scoliosis on the lumbar spine, curve to the left, but no evidence of other abnormalities."
Neurology," A CT pelvis study performed on November 07, 2008 showed some nonspecific fluid in the subcutaneous fat of the back, posterior to L4 and L5 levels; however, there were no pelvic masses or other abnormalities."
Neurology, We were able to obtain an update of the report from the MRI of the lumbar spine with and without contrast dated 12/30/2008.
Neurology," The complete study included the cervical, thoracic, and lumbar spine."
Neurology, There was diffuse enhancement of the nerve roots of the cauda equina that had increased in enhancement since prior exam in November.
Neurology," It was also reported that the patient was given intravenous methylprednisolone and this had had no effect on strength in her lower extremities., IMPRESSION: , The patient has a condition that is temporarily related to the epidural injection she was given at the end of October 2008, prior to her Cesarean section."
Neurology," It appears she became aware of weakness within two days of the administration of the epidural, she was very tired during the epidural and may have missed some change in her neurological function."
Neurology," She was severely weak in both lower extremities, slightly worse on the right than the left."
Neurology, There has been some interval improvement in her strength since the beginning of November 2008.
Neurology, Her EMG study from the end of December is most consistent with a lumbosacral polyradiculopathy.
Neurology, The MRI findings of gadolinium enhancement in the lumbar nerve roots would be most consistent with an inflammatory radiculitis most likely related to the epidural anesthesia or administration of the epidural.
Neurology, There had been no response to IV methylprednisolone given to her at ABC.
Neurology, The issue of having a lumbar puncture to look for evidence of inflammatory cells or an elevated protein had been discussed with her at both ABC and by myself.
Neurology, The patient did not wish to consider a lumbar puncture because of concerns that this might worsen her condition.
Neurology," At the present time, she is able to stand with aid but is unable to walk."
Neurology, There is no evidence on her previous EMG of a demyelinating neuropathy.
Neurology,", RECOMMENDATIONS:, 1."
Neurology, The diagnostic issues were discussed with the patient at length.
Neurology," She is informed that this is still early in the course of the problem and that we expect her to show some improvement in her function over the next one to two years, although it is unclear as to how much function she will regain., 2."
Neurology," She is strongly recommended to continue with vigorous physical therapy, and to continue with the plan to mobilize her as much as possible, with the goal of trying to get her ambulatory."
Neurology," If she is able to walk, she will need bilateral AFOs for her ankles, to improve her overall mobility."
Neurology," I am not prescribing these because at the present time she does not need them., 3."
Neurology, We discussed increasing the dose of gabapentin.
Neurology," The paresthesias that she has may indicate that she is actually regaining some sensory function, although there is a concern that as recovery continues, she may be left with significant neuropathic pain."
Neurology," If this is the case, I have advised her to increase her gabapentin dose from 300 mg b.i.d."
Neurology,gradually up to 300 mg four times a day and then to 600 mg to 900 mg four times a day.
Neurology, She may need other neuropathic pain medications as needed.
Neurology," She will determine whether her current symptoms are significant enough to require this increase in dosage., 4."

Neurology,"HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  , The patient comes in today because of feeling lightheaded and difficulty keeping his balance."
Neurology, He denies this as a spinning sensation that he had had in the past with vertigo.
Neurology, He just describes as feeling very lightheaded.
Neurology, It usually occurs with position changes such as when he stands up from the sitting position or stands up from a lying position.
Neurology," It tends to ease when he sits down again, but does not totally resolve for another 15 to 30 minutes and he feels shaky and weak all over."
Neurology, Lorazepam did not help this sensation.
Neurology, His blood pressure has been up lately and his dose of metoprolol was increased.
Neurology," They feel these symptoms have gotten worse since metoprolol was increased., PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: , Detailed on our H&P form."

Neurology, Standing up blood pressure was 160/80 with a pulse rate of 56.
Neurology, His general exam and neurological exam were detailed on our H&P form.
Neurology," Pertinent positives on his neurological exam were decreased sensation in his left face, and left arm and leg., IMPRESSION AND PLAN:  , This lightheaded, he exquisitely denies vertigo, the vertigo that he has had in the past."
Neurology, He states this is more of a lightheaded type feeling.
Neurology, He did have a mild blood pressure drop here in the office.
Neurology, We are also concerned that bradycardia might be contributing to his feeling of lightheadedness.
Neurology, We are going to suggest that he gets a Holter monitor and he should speak to his general practitioner as well as his cardiologist regarding the lightheaded feeling.
Neurology,", We will schedule him for the Holter monitor and refer him back to his cardiologist."
Neurology,"CHIEF COMPLAINT:,  Headache., HPI: , This is a 24-year-old man who was seen here originally on the 13th with a headache and found to have a mass on CT scan."

Neurology, I recommended an LP but he prefers not to have this done.
Neurology, He received morphine for pain and his headache improved.
Neurology, I've recommended admission but he has chosen to go home and come back in the morning for his scheduled angiogram.
Neurology, He left the ED against my advice.
Neurology," , IMPRESSION: , Headache, improved."
Neurology," Intracranial aneurysm., PLAN: , The patient will return tomorrow am for his angiogram."
Neurology,"CHIEF COMPLAINT: , Right shoulder pain., HISTORY: , The patient is a pleasant, 31-year-old, right-handed, white female who injured her shoulder while transferring a patient back on 01/01/02."
Neurology, She formerly worked for Veteran's Home as a CNA.
Neurology, She has had a long drawn out course of treatment for this shoulder.
Neurology, She tried physical therapy without benefit and ultimately came to a subacromion decompression in November 2002.
Neurology, She had ongoing pain and was evaluated by Dr. X who felt that she had a possible brachial plexopathy.
Neurology, He also felt she had a right superficial radial neuritis and blocked this with resolution of her symptoms.
Neurology," He then referred her to ABCD who did EMG testing, demonstrating a right suprascapular neuropathy although a C5 radiculopathy could not be ruled out."
Neurology, MRI testing on the cervical spine was then done which was negative for disk herniation and she underwent suprascapular nerve decompression of the scapular notch on 12/18/03.
Neurology, She finally went to an anterior axillary nerve block because of ongoing pain in the anterior shoulder again by Dr. X.  She comes to me for impairment rating.
Neurology," She has no chronic health problems otherwise, fevers, chills, or general malaise."
Neurology, She is not working.
Neurology, She is right-hand dominant.
Neurology," She denies any prior history of injury to her shoulder., PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:,  Negative aside from above., FAMILY HISTORY: , Noncontributory., SOCIAL HISTORY:  , Please see above.,"
Neurology,"REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:,  Negative aside from above., PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  , A pleasant, age appropriate woman, moderately overweight, in no apparent distress."
Neurology," Normal gait and station, normal posture, normal strength, tone, sensation and deep tendon reflexes with the exception of 4+/5 strength in the supraspinatus musculature on the right."
Neurology, She has decreased motion in the right shoulder as follows.
Neurology," She has 160 degrees of flexion, 155 degrees of abduction, 35 degrees of extension, 25 degrees of adduction, 45 degrees of internal rotation and 90 degrees of external rotation."
Neurology," She has a positive impingement sign on the right., ASSESSMENT:,"
Neurology," Right shoulder impingement syndrome, right suprascapular neuropathy., DISCUSSION: , With a reasonable degree of medical certainty, she is at maximum medical improvement and she does have an impairment based on AMA Guide to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment, Fifth Edition."
Neurology, The reason for this impairment is the incident of 01/01/02.
Neurology," For her suprascapular neuropathy, she is rated as a grade IV motor deficit which I rate as a 13% motor deficit."
Neurology," This is multiplied by a maximum upper extremity impairment for involvement of the suprascapular nerve of 16% which produces a 2% impairment of the upper extremity when the two values are multiplied together, 2% impairment of the upper extremity."
Neurology, For her lack of motion in the shoulder she also has additional impairment on the right.
Neurology, She has a 1% impairment of the upper extremity due to lack of shoulder flexion.
Neurology, She has a 1% impairment of the upper extremity due to lack of shoulder abduction.
Neurology, She has a 1% impairment of the upper extremity due to lack of shoulder adduction.
Neurology, She has a 1% impairment of the upper extremity due to lack of shoulder extension.
Neurology, There is no impairment for findings in shoulder external rotation.
Neurology, She has a 3% impairment of the upper extremity due to lack of shoulder internal rotation.
Neurology, Thus the impairment due to lack of motion in her shoulder is a 6% impairment of the upper extremity.
Neurology," This combines with the 2% impairment of the upper extremity due to weakness in the suprascapular nerve root distribution to produce an 8% impairment of the upper extremity which in turn is a 5% impairment of the whole person based on the AMA Guide to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment, Fifth Edition, stated with a reasonable degree of medical certainty."
Neurology,"REASON FOR VISIT: , Ms. ABC is a 67-year-old woman with adult hydrocephalus who returns to clinic for a routine evaluation."
Neurology," She comes to clinic by herself., HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:,  She has been followed for her hydrocephalus since 2002."
Neurology, She also had an anterior cervical corpectomy and fusion from C3 though C5 in March 2007.
Neurology," She was last seen by us in clinic in March 2008 and she was experiencing little bit of head fullness and ringing in the ears at that time; however, we decided to leave her shunt setting at 1.0."
Neurology, We wanted her to followup with Dr. XYZ regarding the MRI of the cervical spine.
Neurology," Today, she tells me that with respect to her bladder last week she had some episodes of urinary frequency, however, this week she is not experiencing the same type of episodes."
Neurology," She reports no urgency, incontinence, and feels that she completely empties her bladder when she goes."
Neurology, She does experience some leakage with coughing.
Neurology, She wears the pad on a daily basis.
Neurology, She does not think that her bladder has changed much since we saw her last.
Neurology," With respect to her thinking and memory, she reports no problems at this time."
Neurology, She reports no headaches at this time.
Neurology," With respect to her walking and balance, she says that it feels worse."
Neurology," In the beginning of May, she had a coughing spell and at that time she developed buttock pain, which travels down the legs."
Neurology, She states that her leg often feel like elastic and she experiences a tingling radiculopathy.
Neurology, She says that this tingling is constant and at times painful.
Neurology, She feels that she is walking slower for this reason.
Neurology, She does not use the cane at this time.
Neurology," Most of the time, she is able to walk over uneven surfaces."
Neurology," She is able to walk up and down stairs and has no trouble getting in and out of a car., MEDICATIONS:,  Rhinocort 32 mg two sprays a day, Singulair 10 mg once a day, Xyzal 5"

Neurology, She does not display any nystagmus at this time.
Neurology," Facial movement, hearing, head turning, tongue, and palate movement are all intact."
Neurology,", Gait:  Assessed using the Tinetti assessment tool, which showed a balance score of 13/16 and a gait score of 11/12 for a total score of 24/28., ASSESSMENT:,  Ms. ABC has been experiencing difficulty with walking over the past several months."
Neurology,", PROBLEMS/DIAGNOSES:, 1."
Neurology," Hydrocephalus., 2."
Neurology," Cervical stenosis and retrolisthesis., 3."
Neurology," Neuropathy in the legs., PLAN: , Before we recommend anything more, we would like to get a hold of the notes from Dr. XYZ to try to come up with a concrete plan as to what we can do next for Ms. ABC."
Neurology, We believe that her walking is most likely not being effected by the hydrocephalus.
Neurology, We would like to see her back in clinic in two and a half months or so.
Neurology," We also talked to her about having her obtain cane training so that she knows how to properly use her cane, which she states she does have one."
Neurology, I suggested that she use the cane at her on discretion.
Neurology,"CC: , RLE weakness., HX: , This 42y/o RHM was found 2/27/95 slumped over the steering wheel of the Fed Ex truck he was driving."
Neurology,He was cyanotic and pulseless according to witnesses.
Neurology,"EMT evaluation revealed him to be in ventricular fibrillation and he was given epinephrine, lidocaine, bretylium and electrically defibrillated and intubated in the field."
Neurology,"Upon arrival at a local ER his cardiac rhythm deteriorated and he required more than 9 counter shocks (defibrillation) at 360 joules per shock, epinephrine and lidocaine."
Neurology,This had no effect.
Neurology,He was then given intracardiac epinephrine and a subsequent electrical defibrillation placed him in atrial fibrillation.
Neurology,He was then taken emergently to cardiac catherization and was found to have normal coronary arteries.
Neurology,He was then admitted to an intensive care unit and required intraortic balloon pump pressure support via the right gorin.
Neurology,His blood pressure gradually improved and his balloon pump was discontinued on 5/5/95.
Neurology,Recovery was complicated by acute renal failure and liver failure.

Neurology," Appropriate central line as well as arterial line, Foley catheter, TED, and SCDs were placed."
Neurology, The patient was positioned supine with a three-point Mayfield head pin holder.
Neurology, Her scalp was prepped and draped in a sterile manner.
Neurology," Her former incisional scar was barely and faintly noticed; however, through the same scalp scar, the same incision was made and extended slightly inferiorly."
Neurology, The scalp was resected anteriorly.
Neurology," The subdural scar was noted, and hemostasis was achieved using Bovie cautery."
Neurology," The temporalis muscle was reflected along with the scalp in a subperiosteal manner, and the titanium plating system was then exposed.,"
Neurology,The titanium plating system was then removed in its entirety.
Neurology," The bone appeared to be quite fused in multiple points, and there were significant granulation tissue through the burr hole covers."
Neurology,", The granulation tissue was quite hemorrhagic, and hemostasis was achieved using bipolar cautery as well as Bovie cautery."
Neurology,","
Neurology,"The bone flap was then removed using Leksell rongeur, and the underlying dura was inspected."
Neurology, It was quite full.
Neurology," The 4-0 sutures from the previous durotomy closure was inspected, and more of the inferior temporal bone was resected using high-speed drill in combination with Leksell rongeur."
Neurology," The sphenoid wing was also resected using a high-speed drill as well as angled rongeur., Hemostasis was achieved on the fresh bony edges using bone wax."
Neurology, The dura pack-up stitches were noted around the periphery from the previous craniotomy.
Neurology, This was left in place.
Neurology,", The microscope was then brought in to use for the remainder of the procedure until closure."
Neurology," Using a #15 blade, a new durotomy was then made."
Neurology," Then, the durotomy was carried out using Metzenbaum scissors, then reflected the dura anteriorly in a horseshoe manner, placed anteriorly, and this was done under the operating microscope."
Neurology, The underlying brain was quite edematous.
Neurology,", Along the temporal lobe there was a stain of xanthochromia along the surface."
Neurology," Thus a corticectomy was then accomplished using bipolar cautery, and the temporal lobe at this level and the middle temporal gyrus was entered."
Neurology, The parenchyma of the brain did not appear normal.
Neurology, It was quite vascular.
Neurology," Furthermore, there was a hematoma mixed in with the brain itself."
Neurology, Thus a core biopsy was then performed in the temporal tip.
Neurology," The overlying dura was inspected and it was quite thickened, approximately 0.25 cm thick, and it was also highly vascular, and thus a big section of the dura was also trimmed using bipolar cautery followed by scissors, and several pieces of this vascularized dura was resected for pathology."
Neurology," Furthermore, sample of the temporal lobe was cultured."
Neurology,", Hemostasis after evacuation of the intracerebral hematoma using controlled suction as well as significant biopsy of the overlying dura as well as intraparenchymal lesion was accomplished."
Neurology, No attempt was made to enter into the sylvian fissure.
Neurology," Once hemostasis was meticulously achieved, the brain was inspected."
Neurology," It still was quite swollen, known that there was still hematoma in the parenchyma of the brain."
Neurology," However, at this time it was felt that since there is no diagnosis made intraoperatively, we would need to stage this surgery further should it be needed once the diagnosis is confirmed."
Neurology, DuraGen was then used for duraplasty because of the resected dura.
Neurology, The bone flap was then repositioned using Lorenz plating system.
Neurology, Then a medium Hemovac drain was placed in subdural space.
Neurology, Temporalis muscle was approximated using 2-0 Vicryl.
Neurology, The galea was then reapproximated using inverted 2-0 Vicryl.
Neurology, The scalp was then reapproximated using staples.
Neurology, The head was then dressed and wrapped in a sterile fashion.
Neurology,", She was witnessed to be extubated in the operating room postoperatively, and she followed commands briskly."
Neurology, The pupils are 3 mm bilaterally reactive to light.
Neurology, I accompanied her and transported her to the ICU where I signed out to the ICU attending.

Neurology," Next, the epidural space was encountered."
Neurology, There was no additional hematoma in the epidural space or on the thecal sac.
Neurology, A curette was carefully used to scrape along the thecal sac and there was no film or lining covering the sac.
Neurology, The inferior edge of the C2 lamina was explored and there was no compression at this level and the superior lamina of T1 was explored and again no compression was identified at this area as well.
Neurology," Next, the wound was irrigated copiously with one liter of saline using a syringe."
Neurology, The walls of the wound were explored.
Neurology, There was no active bleeding.
Neurology," Retractors were removed at this time and even without pressure on the musculature, there was no active bleeding."
Neurology, A #19 French Hemovac drain was passed percutaneously at this point and placed into the epidural space.
Neurology," Fascia was reapproximated with #1 Vicryl sutures, subcutaneous tissue with #3-0 Vicryl sutures."
Neurology, Steri-Strips covered the incision and dressing was then applied over the incision.
Neurology, The patient was then log rolled in the supine position on the hospital gurney.
Neurology, She remained intubated for airway precautions and transferred to the recovery room in stable condition.

Neurology, He scored 26/30 on the MMSE when tested with spelling and 25/30 when tested with calculations.
Neurology," Of note, he was able to get two of the three memory words with cuing and the third one with multiple choice."
Neurology, This was a slight improvement over his initial score of 23/30 with calculations and 24/30 with spelling and at that time he was unable to remember any memory words with cuing and only one with multiple choice.
Neurology,", Gait:  Tested using the Tinetti assessment tool."
Neurology, He was tested without an assistive device and received a gait score of 6-8/12 and a balance of score of 12/16 for a total score of 18-20/28.

Neurology," Cognitive impairment (290.0)., PLAN:,  I had a long discussion with Mr. A and his daughter."
Neurology," We are all pleased that he has started to make some improvement with his hydrocephalus because I believe I see a tiny fluid collection in the right parietal region, I would like to leave the setting at 2.0 for another three months before we consider changing the shunt."
Neurology," I do not believe that this tiny amount of fluid is symptotic and it was not documented by the radiologist when he read the CT scan., Mr. A asked me about whether he will be able to drive again."
Neurology," Unfortunately, I think it is unlikely that his speed of movement will improve to a level that he will be able to pass a driver's safety evaluation, however, occasionally patients surprise me by improving enough over 9 to 12 months that they are able to pass such a test."
Neurology," I would certainly be happy to recommend such a test if I believe , Mr. A is likely to pass it and he is always welcome to enroll in a driver's safety program without my recommendation, however, I think it is exceeding unlikely that he has the capability of passing this rigorous test at this time."
Neurology, I also think it is quite likely he will not regain sufficient speed of motion to pass such a test.

Neurology, The entire left scalp was prepped and draped in the usual fashion after having being placed in 2-point skeletal fixation.
Neurology," Next, we made an inverted-U fashion base over the asterion over temporoparietal area of the skull."
Neurology, A free flap was elevated after the scalp that was reflected using the burr hole and craniotome.
Neurology, The bone flap was placed aside and soaked in the bacitracin solution.
Neurology,","
Neurology,The dura was then opened in an inverted-U fashion.
Neurology," Using the Stealth, we could see that this large cystic mass was just below the cortex in the white matter just anterior to the trigone of the ventricle."
Neurology," We head through the vein of Labbe, and we made great care to preserve this."
Neurology, We saw where the tumor almost made to the surface.
Neurology, Here we made a small corticectomy using the Stealth for guidance.
Neurology, We left small corticectomy entered large cavity with approximately 15 cc of yellowish necrotic liquid.
Neurology, This was submitted to pathology.
Neurology, We biopsied this very abnormal tissue and submitted it to pathology.
Neurology, They gave us a frozen section diagnosis of glioblastoma multiforme.
Neurology," With the operating microscope and Greenwood bipolar forceps, we then systematically debulked this tumor."
Neurology, It was very vascular and we really continued to remove this tumor until all visible tumors was removed.
Neurology, We appeared to get two gliotic planes circumferentially.
Neurology, We could see it through the ventricle.
Neurology," After removing all visible tumor grossly, we then irrigated this cavity multiple times and obtained meticulous hemostasis and then closed the dura primarily with 4-0 Nurolon sutures with the piece of DuraGen placed over this in order to increase our chances for a good watertight seal."
Neurology, The bone flap was then replaced and sutured with the Lorenz titanium plate system.
Neurology, The muscle fascia galea was closed with interrupted 2-0 Vicryl sutures.
Neurology, Skin staples were used for skin closure.
Neurology, The blood loss of the operation was about 200 cc.
Neurology, There were no complications of the surgery per se.
Neurology," The needle count, sponge count, and the cottonoid count were correct."
Neurology,", COMMENT:  , Operating microscope was quite helpful in this; as we could use the light as well as the magnification to help us delineate the brain tumor - gliotic interface and while it was vague at sometimes we could I think clearly get a good cleavage plane in most instances so that we got a gross total removal of this very large and necrotic-looking tumor of the brain."
Neurology,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Left acoustic neuroma., POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Left acoustic neuroma., PROCEDURE PERFORMED: , Left retrosigmoid craniotomy and excision of acoustic neuroma., ANESTHESIA:,  General., OPERATIVE FINDINGS: , This patient had a 3-cm acoustic neuroma."
Neurology, The tumor was incompletely excised leaving a remnant of the tumor along the cerebellopontine angle portion of the facial nerve.
Neurology," The facial nerve was stimulated at the brainstem at 0.05 milliamperes at the conclusion of the dissections., PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:  , Following induction of adequate general anesthetic, the patient was positioned for surgery."
Neurology, She was placed in a lateral position and her head was maintained with Mayfield pins.
Neurology," The left periauricular area was shaved, prepped, and draped in the sterile fashion."
Neurology," Transdermal electrodes for continuous facial nerve EMG monitoring were placed, and no response was verified."
Neurology, The proposed incision was injected with 1% Xylocaine with epinephrine.
Neurology," Next, T-shaped incision was made approximately 5 cm behind the postauricular crease."
Neurology," The incision was undermined at the level of temporalis fascia, and the portion of the fascia was harvested for further use., Incision was made along the inferior aspect of the temporalis muscle and then extended inferiorly over the mastoid tip."
Neurology, Periosteal elevator was used to elevate periosteum in order to expose the mastoid and anterior aspect of the occipital bone.
Neurology, Emissary veins posterior to the sigmoid sinus were controlled with electrocautery and bone wax.
Neurology, Bergen retractors were used to maintain exposure.
Neurology, Using a cutting bur with continuous suction and irrigation of craniotomy was performed.
Neurology, The sigmoid sinus was identified anteriorly and the transverse sites were identified superiorly.
Neurology," From these structures approximately 4 x 4 cm, a window of bone was removed."
Neurology, Bone shavings were collected during the dissection and placed in Siloxane suspension for later use.
Neurology, The bone flap was also left at the site for further use.
Neurology, Dissection was extended along the inferior aspect of the sigmoid sinus to provide additional exposure of the skull base.
Neurology, Bone wax was used to occlude air cells lateral to the sigmoid sinus.
Neurology, There was extensively aerated temporal bone.
Neurology," At this point, Dr. Trask entered the case in order to open the dura and expose the tumor."
Neurology," The cerebellum was retracted away from the tumor, and the retractor was placed to help maintain exposure."
Neurology," Once initial exposure was completed, attention was directed to the posterior aspect of the temporal bone."
Neurology, The dura was excised from around the porous acusticus extending posteriorly along the bone.
Neurology," Then, using diamond burs, the internal auditory canal was dissected out."
Neurology, The bone was removed laterally for distance of approximately 8 mm.
Neurology, There was considerable aeration around the internal auditory canal as well.
Neurology, The dura was then incised over the internal auditory canal exposing the intracanalicular portion of the tumor.
Neurology, The tumor extended all the way to the fundus such that initial exposure of the facial nerve around the tumor was difficult.
Neurology," Therefore, Dr. Trask returned in order to further release the tumor from the brainstem and to debulk the central portions of the tumor."
Neurology," With dissection, he released the tumor from the trigeminal nerve superiorly and elevated the tumor away from the dorsal brainstem."
Neurology, The eighth nerve was identified and transected.
Neurology, Tumor debulking allowed for retraction of the tumor capsule away from the brainstem.
Neurology, The facial nerve was difficult to identify at the brainstem as well.
Neurology, It was identified by using an electrical stimulator but dissection attempted at this time was the plane between the nerve and the tumor proximally but this was difficult to achieve.
Neurology, Attention was then redirected to the internal auditory canal where this portion of the tumor was removed.
Neurology, The superior and inferior vestibular nerves were evulsed laterally and dissection proceeded along the facial nerve to the porous acusticus.
Neurology," At this point, plane of dissection was again indistinct."
Neurology, The tumor had been released from the porous and could be rotated.
Neurology," The tumor was further debulked and thinned, but could not crucially visualize the nerve on the anterior face of the tumor."
Neurology," The nerve could be stimulated, but was quite splayed over the anterior face."
Neurology," Further debulking of the tumor proceeded and additional attempts were made to establish point of dissection along the nerve, both proximally and distally."
Neurology," However, the cerebellopontine angle portion of the nerve was not usually delineated."
Neurology," However, the tumor was then thinned using CUSA down to fine sheath measuring only about 1 to 2 mm in thickness."
Neurology, It was released from the brainstem ventrally.
Neurology, The tumor was then cauterized with bipolar electrocautery.
Neurology, The facial nerve was stimulated at the brainstem and stimulated easily at 0.05 milliamperes.
Neurology," Overall, the remaining tumor volume would be of small percentage of the original volume."
Neurology," At this point, Dr. Trask re-inspected the posterior fossa to ensure complete hemostasis."
Neurology, The air cells around the internal auditory canal were packed off with muscle and bone wax.
Neurology, A piece of fascia was then laid over the bone defect.
Neurology," Next, the dura was closed with DuraGen and DuraSeal."
Neurology, The bone flap and bone ***** were then placed in the bone defect.
Neurology, Postauricular musculature was then reapproximated using interrupted 3-0 Vicryl sutures.
Neurology, The skin was also closed using interrupted subdermal 3-0 Vicryl sutures.
Neurology, Running 4-0 nylon suture was placed at the skin levels.
Neurology, Sterile mastoid dressing was then placed.
Neurology, The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transported to the PACU in a stable condition.
Neurology, All counts were correct at the conclusion of the procedure.
Neurology,", ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:  , 100 mL."
Neurology,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Brain tumors, multiple., POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:,  Brain tumors multiple - adenocarcinoma and metastasis from breast., PROCEDURE:,  Occipital craniotomy, removal of large tumor using the inner hemispheric approach, stealth system operating microscope and CUSA., PROCEDURE:,"
Neurology, The patient was placed in the prone position after general endotracheal anesthesia was administered.
Neurology, The scalp was prepped and draped in the usual fashion.
Neurology," The CUSA was brought in to supplement the use of operating microscope as well as the stealth, which was used to localize the tumor."
Neurology," Following this, we then made a transverse linear incision, the scalp galea was reflected and the quadrilateral bone flap was removed after placing burr holes in the midline and over the parietal areas directly over the tumor."
Neurology, The bone flap was elevated.
Neurology, The ultrasound was then used.
Neurology, The ultrasound showed the tumors directly I believe are in the interhemispheric fissure.
Neurology, We noticed that the dura was quite tense despite that the patient had slight hyperventilation.
Neurology," We gave 4 ounce of mannitol, the brain became more pulsatile."
Neurology, We then used the stealth to perform a ventriculostomy.
Neurology," Once this was done, the brain began to pulsate nicely."
Neurology, We then entered the interhemispheric space after we incised the dura in an inverted U fashion based on the superior side of the sinus.
Neurology, After having done this we then used operating microscope and slight self-retaining retraction was used.
Neurology, We obtained access to the tumor.
Neurology, We biopsied this and submitted it.
Neurology," This was returned as a malignant brain tumor - metastatic tumor, adenocarcinoma compatible with breast cancer.,"
Neurology,Following this we then debulked this tumor using CUSA and then removed it in total.
Neurology," After gross total removal of this tumor, the irrigation was used to wash the tumor bed and a meticulous hemostasis was then obtained using bipolar cautery."
Neurology," The next step was after removal of this tumor, closure of the wound, a large piece of Duragen was placed over the dural defect and the bone flap was reapproximated and held secured with Lorenz plates."
Neurology," The tumors self extend into the ventricle and after we had removed the tumor, we could see our ventricular catheter in the occipital horn of the ventricle."
Neurology," This being the case, we left this ventricular catheter in, brought it out through a separate incision and connected to sterile drainage."
Neurology, The next step was to close the wound after reapproximating the bone flap.
Neurology, The galea was closed with 2-0 Vicryl and the skin was closed with interrupted 3-0 nylon sutures inverted with mattress sutures.
Neurology, The sterile dressings were applied to the scalp.
Neurology, The patient returned to the recovery room in satisfactory condition.
Neurology," Hemodynamically remained stable throughout the operation.,"
Neurology,"Once again, we performed occipital craniotomy, total removal of her large metastatic tumor involving the parietal lobe using a biparietal craniotomy."
Neurology," The tumor was removed using the combination of CUSA, ultrasound, stealth guided-ventriculostomy and the patient will have a second operation today, we will perform a selective craniectomy to remove another large tumor in the posterior fossa."

Neurology," A year ago, she was diagnosed with cranial metastases and underwent whole brain radiation."
Neurology," She recently has deteriorated such that she came to my office, unable to ambulate in a wheelchair."
Neurology," Metastatic workup does reveal multiple bone metastases, but no spinal cord compression."
Neurology," She had a consult with Radiation-Oncology that decided they could radiate her metastases less than 3 cm with stereotactic radiosurgery, but the lesions greater than 3 cm needed to be removed."
Neurology," Consequently, this operation is performed., PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , The patient underwent a planning MRI scan with Stealth protocol."
Neurology, She was brought to the operating room with fiducial still on her scalp.
Neurology, General endotracheal anesthesia was obtained.
Neurology, She was placed on the Mayfield head holder and rolled into the prone position.
Neurology," She was well padded, secured, and so forth."
Neurology, The neck was flexed so as to expose the right suboccipital region as well as the left and right parietooccipital regions.
Neurology, The posterior aspect of the calvarium was shaved and prepared in the usual manner with Betadine soak scrub followed by Betadine paint.
Neurology," This was done only, of course, after fiducial were registered in planning and an excellent accuracy was obtained with the Stealth system."
Neurology, Sterile drapes were applied and the accuracy of the system was confirmed.
Neurology, A biparietal incision was performed.
Neurology, A linear incision was chosen so as to increase her chances of successful wound healing and that she is status post whole brain radiation.
Neurology," A biparietal craniotomy was carried out, carrying about 1 cm over toward the right side and about 4 cm over to the left side as guided by the Stealth stereotactic system."
Neurology, The dura was opened and reflected back to the midline.
Neurology, An inner hemispheric approach was used to reach the very large metastatic tumor.
Neurology, This was very delicate removing the tumor and the co-surgeons switched off to spare one another during the more delicate parts of the operation to remove the tumor.
Neurology, The tumor was wrapped around and included the choroidal vessels.
Neurology, At least one choroidal vessel was sacrificed in order to obtain a gross total excision of the tumor on the parietal occipital region.
Neurology," Bleeding was quite vigorous in some of the arteries and finally, however, was completely controlled."
Neurology," Complete removal of the tumor was confirmed by intraoperative ultrasound.,"
Neurology,"Once the tumor had been removed and meticulous hemostasis was obtained, this wound was left opened and attention was turned to the right suboccipital area."
Neurology, A linear incision was made just lateral to the greater occipital nerve.
Neurology, Sharp dissection was carried down in the subcutaneous tissues and Bovie electrocautery was used to reach the skull.
Neurology, A burr hole was placed down low using a craniotome.
Neurology, A craniotomy was turned and then enlarged as a craniectomy to at least 4 cm in diameter.
Neurology, It was carried caudally to the floor of the posterior fossa and rostrally to the transverse sinus.
Neurology, Stealth and ultrasound were used to localize the very large tumor that was within the horizontal hemisphere of the cerebellum.
Neurology," The ventriculostomy had been placed on the left side with the craniotomy and removal of the tumor, and this was draining CSF relieving pressure in the posterior fossa."
Neurology," Upon opening the craniotomy in the parietal occipital region, the brain was noted to be extremely tight, thus necessitating placement of the ventriculostomy.,"
Neurology,"At the posterior fossa, a corticectomy was accomplished and the tumor was countered directly."
Neurology," The tumor, as the one above, was removed, both piecemeal and with intraoperative Cavitron Ultrasonic Aspirator."
Neurology, A gross total excision of this tumor was obtained as well.
Neurology,", I then explored underneath the cerebellum in hopes of finding another metastasis in the CP angle; however, this was just over the lower cranial nerves, and rather than risk paralysis of pharyngeal muscles and voice as well as possibly hearing loss, this lesion was left alone and to be radiated and that it is less than 3 cm in diameter."
Neurology,", Meticulous hemostasis was obtained for this wound as well.,"
Neurology,The posterior fossa wound was then closed in layers.
Neurology, The dura was closed with interrupted and running mattress of 4-0 Nurolon.
Neurology," The dura was watertight, and it was covered with blue glue."
Neurology, Gelfoam was placed over the dural closure.
Neurology," Then, the muscle and fascia were closed in individual layers using #0 Ethibond."
Neurology," Subcutaneous was closed with interrupted inverted 2-0 and 0 Vicryl, and the skin was closed with running locking 3-0 Nylon.,"
Neurology,"For the cranial incision, the ventriculostomy was brought out through a separate stab wound."
Neurology, The bone flap was brought on to the field.
Neurology, The dura was closed with running and interrupted 4-0 Nurolon.
Neurology," At the beginning of the case, dural tack-ups had been made and these were still in place."
Neurology," The sinuses, both the transverse sinus and sagittal sinus, were covered with thrombin-soaked Gelfoam to take care of any small bleeding areas in the sinuses."
Neurology,", Once the dura was closed, the bone flap was returned to the wound and held in place with the Lorenz microplates."
Neurology, The wound was then closed in layers.
Neurology, The galea was closed with multiple sutures of interrupted 2-0 Vicryl.
Neurology, The skin was closed with a running locking 3-0 Nylon.
Neurology,", Estimated blood loss for the case was more than 1 L.  The patient received 2 units of packed red cells during the case as well as more than 1 L of Hespan and almost 3 L of crystalloid."

Neurology, The right calvarium was shaved and prepared in the usual manner with Betadine-soaked scrub followed by Betadine paint.
Neurology, Markings were applied.
Neurology, Sterile drapes were applied.
Neurology, A linear incision was made more or less along the coronal suture extending from just above the ear up to near the midline.
Neurology, Sharp dissection was carried down into subcutaneous tissue and Bovie electrocautery was used to divide the galea and the temporalis muscle and fascia.
Neurology, Weitlaner retractors were inserted.
Neurology, A single bur hole was placed underneath the temporalis muscle.
Neurology, I placed the craniotomy a bit low in order to have better cosmesis.
Neurology, A cookie cutter type craniotomy was then carried out in dimensions about 5 cm x 4 cm.
Neurology, The bone was set aside.
Neurology, The dura was clearly discolored and very tense.
Neurology, The dura was opened in a cruciate fashion with a #15 blade.
Neurology, There was immediate flow of a thin motor oil fluid under high pressure.
Neurology, Literally the fluid shot out several inches with the first nick in the membranous cavity.
Neurology, The dura was reflected back and biopsy of the membranes was taken and sent for permanent section.
Neurology, The margins of the membrane were coagulated.
Neurology, The microscope was brought in and it was apparent there were septations within the cavity and these septations were for the most part divided with bipolar electrocautery.
Neurology, The wound was irrigated thoroughly and was inspected carefully for any sites of bleeding and there were none.
Neurology, The dura was then closed in a watertight fashion using running locking 4-0 Nurolon.
Neurology, Tack-up sutures had been placed at the beginning of the case and the bone flap was returned to the wound and fixed to the skull using the Lorenz plating system.
Neurology, The wound was irrigated thoroughly once more and was closed in layers.
Neurology, Muscle fascia and galea were closed in separate layers with interrupted inverted 2-0 Vicryl.
Neurology," Finally, the skin was closed with running locking 3-0 nylon."
Neurology,", Estimated blood loss for the case was less than 30 mL.  Sponge and needle counts were correct., FINDINGS: , Chronic subdural hematoma with multiple septations and thickened subdural membrane."
Neurology,", I might add that the arachnoid was not violated at all during this procedure."
Neurology," Also, it was noted that there was no subarachnoid blood but only subdural blood."
Neurology,"REASON FOR VISIT: , The patient is an 84-year-old man who returns for revaluation of possible idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus."
Neurology," He is accompanied by his wife and daughter., HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:,  I first saw him nearly a year ago on December 20, 2007."
Neurology," At that time, he had had a traumatic deterioration over the course of approximately eight months."
Neurology," This included severe cognitive impairment, gait impairment, and incontinence."
Neurology," He had actually been evaluated at Hospital with CSF drainage via a temporary spinal catheter, but there was no response that was noted."
Neurology," When I saw him, there were findings consistent with cervical stenosis and I ordered an MRI scan of the cervical spine."
Neurology," I subsequently referred him to Dr. X, who performed a cervical laminectomy and instrumented fusion on July 16, 2008."
Neurology," According to his notes this went well.,"
Neurology,"According to the family, there has not been any improvement.,"
Neurology,"With regard to the gait and balance, they actually think that he is worse now than he was a year ago."
Neurology, He is virtually unable to walk at all.
Neurology, He needs both a walker and support from an assistant to be able to stand or walk.
Neurology," Therefore, he is always in the wheelchair."
Neurology,", He is completely incontinent."
Neurology, He never indicates his need to the go to the bathroom.
Neurology," On the other hand when asked, he will indicate that he needs to go."
Neurology, He wears a Depends undergarment all the time.

Neurology,"mg three times a day, citalopram (Celexa) 40 mg daily, Colace 100 mg twice a day, finasteride (Proscar) 5 mg once a day, Flomax (tamsulosin) 0.4"
Neurology,"mg once a day, multivitamin with iron once a day, omeprazole (Prilosec)"
Neurology,"20 mg once a day, senna 8.6 mg twice a day, Tylenol 650 mg as needed, and promethazine 25 mg as needed., PHYSICAL EXAM: , On examination today, this is a pleasant 81-year-old man who is brought back from the clinic waiting area in a wheelchair."
Neurology," He is well developed, well nourished, and kempt."
Neurology,", Vital Signs:  Temperature 96.7, pulse 62, respirations 16, and blood pressure 123/71., Head:  The head is normocephalic and atraumatic., Mental Status:  Assessed for orientation, recent and remote memory, attention span, concentration, language, and fund of knowledge."
Neurology, The Mini-Mental State Exam score was 14/30.
Neurology, He was not at all oriented.
Neurology, He did know we were at Sinai Hospital on the second floor.
Neurology," He could spell 'world' forward, but was mute when asked to spell backwards."
Neurology, He was mute when asked to recall 3/3 objects for delayed recall.
Neurology, He could not copy a diagram of intersecting pentagons.
Neurology," For comparison, the Mini-Mental State exam score last December was 20/30 when attention was tested by having him spell 'world' backwards and 28/30 when tested with serial 7 subtractions."
Neurology," Additionally, there are times when he stutters or stammers."
Neurology, I do not see any paraphasic errors.
Neurology, There is some evidence of ideomotor apraxia.
Neurology, He is also stimulus bound.
Neurology," There is a tendency to mimic., Cranial Nerve Exam:  There is no upgaze that I can elicit today."
Neurology, The horizontal gaze and down gaze are intact.
Neurology, This is a change from a year ago.
Neurology," The muscles of facial expiration are intact as are hearing, head turning, cough, tongue, and palate movement., Motor Exam:  Normal bulk and strength."
Neurology, The tone is characterized by paratonia.
Neurology," There is no atrophy, fasciculations, drift, or tremor."
Neurology,", Sensory Exam:  Intact to light touch., Cerebellar Exam:  Intact for finger-to-nose testing that he can perform only by mimicking, but not by following verbal commands."
Neurology,", Gait:  Severely impaired."
Neurology," When in the wheelchair, he leans to one side."
Neurology, He cannot getup on his own.
Neurology, He needs assistance.
Neurology," Once up, he can bear weight, but cannot maintain his balance."
Neurology," This would amount to a Tinetti score of zero., REVIEW OF X-RAYS: , I personally reviewed the CT scan of the brain from November 1, 2008 and compared it to the MRI scan from a year ago."
Neurology, The ventricles appear larger to me now in comparison to a year ago.
Neurology," The frontal horn span is now 6 cm, whereas previously it was about 5.5 cm."
Neurology, The 3rd ventricular span is about 15 mm.
Neurology," There is no obvious atrophy, although there may be some subtle bilateral perisylvian atrophy."
Neurology," The scan from a year ago showed that there was a patent sylvian aqueduct.,"
Neurology,"ASSESSMENT:,  The patient has had worsening of his gait, his dementia, and his incontinence."
Neurology, The new finding for me today is the limited upgaze.
Neurology," This would be consistent either with progressive supranuclear palsy, which was one of the differential diagnoses a year ago, or it could be consistent with progressive enlargement of the ventricles., PROBLEMS/DIAGNOSES:, 1."
Neurology," Question of idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (331.5)., 2."
Neurology," Possible supranuclear palsy., 3."
Neurology," Severe gait impairment., 4."
Neurology," Urinary urgency and incontinence., 5."
Neurology," Dementia., PLAN: , I had a long talk with him and his family."
Neurology," Even though he has already had a trial of CSF drainage via spinal catheter at Hospital over a year ago, I offered this test to them again."
Neurology, I do so on the basis that there is further enlargement of the ventricles on the scan.
Neurology, His family and I discussed the facts that it is not likely to be only hydrocephalus.
Neurology, Instead we are trying to answer the question of whether hydrocephalus is contributing sufficiently to his symptoms that progressing with shunt surgery would make a difference.
Neurology, I have advised them to think it over for a day and contact my office to see whether they would wish to proceed.
Neurology," I gave them a printed prescription of the protocol including its rationale, risks, benefits, and alternatives."
Neurology," I specifically mentioned the 3% chance of infection, which mean a 97% chance of no infection."
Neurology,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Right chronic subdural hematoma., POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Right chronic subdural hematoma., TYPE OF OPERATION: , Right burr hole craniotomy for evacuation of subdural hematoma and placement of subdural drain., ANESTHESIA: , General endotracheal anesthesia., ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: , 100 cc., OPERATIVE PROCEDURE:,  In preoperative identification, the patient was taken to the operating room and placed in supine position."

Neurology," We tactfully discussed the patient's diagnosis with her, and she felt reassured."
Neurology, We told her that this most likely was in the earlier stages of disease and she would benefit from trying Aricept.
Neurology," She stated that she did not have the prescription anymore from her outpatient neurology consult for the Aricept, so we wrote her another prescription for Aricept."
Neurology," The patient herself seemed very concerned about the stigma of the disease, but our lengthy discussion, expressed genuine understanding as to why her outpatient physician had reported her to DMV."
Neurology, It was explicitly told to not drive by her outpatient neurologist and we concur with this assessment.
Neurology, She will follow up with us in the next six months and will call us if she has any problems with the Aricept.
Neurology," She was written for Aricept to start at 5 mg for three weeks, and if she has no side effects which typically are GI side effects, then she can go up to 10 mg a day."
Neurology," We also reviewed with Ms. A the findings for outpatient MRI, which showed some mild atrophy per report and also that her metabolic workup, which included an RPR, TSH, and B12 were all within normal limits.,"
Neurology,"FAMILY HISTORY AND SOCIAL HISTORY:,  Reviewed and remained unchanged., MEDICATIONS:,  List remained unchanged including Plavix, aspirin, levothyroxine, lisinopril, hydrochlorothiazide, Lasix, insulin and simvastatin., ALLERGIES:,  She has no known drug allergies., FALL RISK ASSESSMENT: ,"

Neurology, No ataxia noted.
Neurology," Wide-based, ambulated with a cane., IMPRESSION: , Status post cerebrovascular accident involving the right upper pons extending into the right cerebral peduncle with a mild left hemiparesis, has been clinically stable with mild improvement."
Neurology," She is planned for surgical intervention for the internal carotid artery., RECOMMENDATIONS: , At this time, again we discussed continued use of antiplatelet therapy and statin therapy to reduce her risk of future strokes."
Neurology, She will continue to follow with endocrinology for diabetes and thyroid problems.
Neurology," I have recommended a strict control of her blood sugar, optimizing cholesterol and blood pressure control, regular exercise and healthy diet and I have discussed with Ms. A and her daughter to give us a call for post surgical recovery."
Neurology, I will see her back in about four months or sooner if needed.
Neurology,"REASON FOR REFERRAL: , Facial twitching., HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , The patient had several episodes where she felt like her face was going to twitch, which she could suppress it with grimacing movements of her mouth and face."
Neurology, She reports she is still having right posterior head pressure like sensations approximately one time per week.
Neurology," These still are characterized by a tingling, pressure like sensation that often has a feeling as though water is running down on her hair."
Neurology, This has also decreased in frequency occurring approximately one time per week and seems to respond to over-the-counter analgesics such as Aleve.
Neurology," Lastly during conversation today, she brought again the problem of daydreaming at work and noted that she occasionally falls asleep when sitting in non-stimulating environments or in front of the television."
Neurology, She states that she feels fatigued all the time and does not get good sleep.
Neurology," She describes it as insomnia, but upon questioning she works from 4 till mid night and then gets home and cannot go to sleep for approximately two hours and wakes up reliably by 9.00 a.m. each morning and sleeps no more than five to six hours ever, but usually five hours."
Neurology, Her sleep is relatively uninterrupted except for the need to get up and go to the bathroom.

Neurology," Otherwise, general examination is unremarkable., NEUROLOGICAL EXAMINATION:  , As before is nonfocal."
Neurology," Please see note in chart for details., PERTINENT FINDINGS: , Since the last evaluation, she has had an MRI performed, which was largely unremarkable except for a 1.2 cm lobular T2 hyperintense abnormality at the right clivus and petrous carotid canal, which does not enhance."
Neurology, The nature of this lesion is unclear.
Neurology," Certainly, this abnormality would not explain her left facial twitching and is unlikely to be involved with the right posterior sensory changes she experiences.,"
Neurology,"LABS: , She was supposed to have Lyme titers and thyroid tests as well as fasting glucose, which were not done; however, in light of her improvement these may not need to be performed at this time."
Neurology,", IMPRESSION:, 1."
Neurology, Left facial twitching-appears to be improving.
Neurology," Most likely, this is a peripheral nerve injury related to her abscess as previously described."
Neurology," In light of her negative MRI and clinical improvement, we discussed options and elected to just observe for now., 2."
Neurology," Posterior pressure like headache, also appears to be improving."
Neurology," The etiology is unclear, but as it responds nicely to nonsteroidal antiinflammatories and is decreasing, no further evaluation is needed., 3."
Neurology, Probable circadian sleep disorder related to her nighttime work schedule and awakening at 9.00 a.m. with insufficient sleep.
Neurology, There is also the possibility of consistent obstructive sleep apnea and if symptoms worsen then we should consider doing a sleep study.
Neurology," For the time being, sleep hygiene measures were discussed with the patient including trying to sleep later at least till 10.00 a.m. or 10.30 to get a full-night sleep."
Neurology, She is on vacation next week and is going to try to see if this will help.
Neurology," We also discussed as before weight loss and exercise, which could be helpful., 4."
Neurology, Right clivus and petrous lesion of unknown etiology.
Neurology," We will repeat the MRI at four months to see for interval change., 5."
Neurology, The patient voiced understanding of these plans and will be following up with me in five months.
Neurology,"CC:, Intermittent binocular horizontal, vertical, and torsional diplopia., HX: , 70y/o RHM referred by Neuro-ophthalmology for evaluation of neuromuscular disease."
Neurology,"In 7/91, he began experiencing intermittent binocular horizontal, vertical and torsional diplopia which was worse and frequent at the end of the day, and was eliminated when closing one either eye."
Neurology,An MRI Brain scan at that time was unremarkable.
Neurology,He was seen at UIHC Strabismus Clinic in 5/93 for these symptoms.
Neurology,"On exam, he was found to have intermittent right hypertropia in primary gaze, and consistent diplopia in downward and rightward gaze."
Neurology,This was felt to possibly represent Grave's disease.
Neurology,"Thyroid function studies were unremarkable, but orbital echography suggested Graves orbitopathy."
Neurology,The patient was then seen in the Neuro-ophthalmology clinic on 12/23/92.
Neurology,His exam remained unchanged.
Neurology,He underwent Tensilon testing which was unremarkable.
Neurology,"On 1/13/93, he was seen again in Neuro-ophthalmology."
Neurology,His exam remained relatively unchanged and repeat Tensilon testing was unremarkable.
Neurology,"He then underwent a partial superior rectus resection, OD, with only mild improvement of his diplopia."
Neurology,During his 8/27/96 Neuro-ophthalmology clinic visit he was noted to have hypertropia OD with left pseudogaze palsy and a right ptosis.
Neurology,The ptosis improved upon administration of Tensilon and he was placed on Mestinon 30mg tid.
Neurology,"His diplopia subsequently improved, but did not resolve."
Neurology,The dosage was increased to 60mg tid and his diplopia worsened and the dose decreased back to 30mg tid.
Neurology,At present he denied any fatigue on repetitive movement.
Neurology,"He denied dysphagia, SOB, dysarthria, facial weakness, fevers, chills, night sweats, weight loss or muscle atrophy., MEDS: , Viokase, Probenecid, Mestinon 30mg tid., PMH:, 1) Gastric ulcer 30 years ago, 2) Cholecystectomy, 3) Pancreatic insufficiency, 4) Gout, 5) Diplopia., FHX:, Mother died age 89 of ""old age."""

Neurology,The patient had been off Mestinon for 8 hours prior to testing.
Neurology,"Chest CT with contrast, 9/26/96, revealed a 4x2.5x4cm centrally calcified soft tissue anterior mediastinal mass adjacent to the aortic arch."
Neurology,This was highly suggestive of a thymoma.
Neurology,There were diffuse emphysematous disease with scarring in the lung bases.
Neurology,A few nodules suggestive of granulomas and few calcified perihilar lymph nodes.
Neurology,He underwent thoracotomy and resection of the mass.
Neurology,"Pathologic analysis was consistent with a thymoma, lymphocyte predominant type, with capsular and pleural invasion, and extension to the phrenic nerve resection margin."
Neurology,"Acetylcholine Receptor-binding antibody titer 12.8nmol/L (normal<0.7), Acetylcholine receptor blocking antibody <10% (normal), Acetylcholine receptor modulating antibody 42% (normal<19), Striated muscle antibody 1: 320 (normal<1: 10)."
Neurology,Striated muscle antibody titers tend to be elevated in myasthenia gravis associated with thymoma.
Neurology,He was subsequently treated with XRT and continued to complain of fatigue at his 4/18/97 Oncology visit.
Neurology,"REASON FOR VISIT:  , Followup cervical spinal stenosis., HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  , Ms. ABC returns today for followup regarding her cervical spinal stenosis."

Neurology," This stenosis is greater than C5-6 and the next level is more significantly involved at C4-5., Effacement of the ventral and dorsal CSF space is seen at C4-5, C5-6., ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: , Ms. ABC's history, physical examination, and radiographic findings are compatible with C4-5, C5-6 cervical spinal stenosis with associated right greater than left upper extremity radiculopathy including weakness."
Neurology,", I spent a significant amount of time today with the patient discussing the diagnosis, prognosis, natural history, nonoperative, and operative treatment options."
Neurology,", I laid out the options as continued nonoperative management with physical therapy, the same with the addition of cervical epidural steroid injections and surgical interventions.,"
Neurology,The patient states she would like to avoid injections and is somewhat afraid of having these done.
Neurology," I explained to her that they may help to improve her symptoms, although they may not help with the weakness."
Neurology,", She feels that she is failing maximum nonoperative management and would like to consider surgical intervention."
Neurology,", I described the procedure consisting of C4-5, C5-6 anterior cervical decompression and fusion to the patient in detail on a spine model."
Neurology,", I explained the rationale for doing so including the decompression of the spinal cord and improvement of her upper extremity weakness and pain."
Neurology, She understands.
Neurology,", I discussed the risks, benefits, and alternative of the procedure including material risks of bleeding, infection, neurovascular injury, dural tear, singular or multiple muscle weakness, paralysis, hoarseness of voice, difficulty swallowing, pseudoarthrosis, adjacent segment disease, and the risk of this given the patient's relatively young age."
Neurology," Of note, the patient does have a hoarse voice right now, given the fact that she feels she has allergies."
Neurology,", I also discussed the option of disk arthroplasty."
Neurology, She understands.
Neurology,", She would like to proceed with the surgery, relatively soon."
Neurology," She has her birthday coming up on 07/20/07 and would like to hold off, until after then."
Neurology, Our tentative date for the surgery is 08/01/07.
Neurology, She will go ahead and continue the preoperative testing process.
Neurology,"As you know, the patient is a 50-year-old right-handed Caucasian female, who works as an independent contractor and as a human resources consultant."
Neurology,", Her neurological history first begins in December of 1987, when she had a rather sudden onset of slurred speech and the hesitancy when she started to walk."
Neurology," She had HMO insurance at that time and saw a neurologist, whose name she does not recall."
Neurology, She thinks that she underwent MRI scan of the brain and possibly visual evoked response and brainstem auditory evoked response tests.
Neurology," She was told that all the tests were normal and no diagnosis was made., The slurred speech resolved after a few weeks, but her gait hesitancy persisted for a number of years and then finally partially improved."
Neurology," She also began to note that she would fatigue after very prolonged walking.,"
Neurology,"In about 1993, she developed bladder urgency and frequency along with some nocturia."
Neurology, She saw a urologist and underwent urodynamic testing.
Neurology," She was diagnosed as having ""overactive bladder"", but the cause of this was never determined."
Neurology," She was treated with medications, possibly Ditropan, without much benefit."
Neurology," She also developed a dry mouth from the medication and so she discontinued it., Also in about 1993, she began to note an uncomfortable ""stiffness"" in her feet and slight swelling of the ankles."
Neurology," Apparently, the swelling was not visible by others."
Neurology," She saw multiple physicians and was told that it was ""not arthritis"", but no definite diagnosis was ever established."
Neurology, She saw at least two rheumatologists on several occasions and blood tests were all normal.
Neurology, No clear-cut diagnosis was ever made and the patient simply learned to live with these symptoms.
Neurology,", However, over time she noted that the symptoms in her legs seemed to worsen somewhat."
Neurology," She states from time-to-time she could ""barely walk""."
Neurology," She felt as if her balance is impaired and she felt as if she were ""walking on stilts""."
Neurology, She tried arch supports from a podiatrist without any benefit.
Neurology," She began to tire more easily when walking.,"
Neurology,"In 2002 she was seen by a podiatrist, who noticed an abnormal gait and recommended that she see a neurologist.,"
Neurology,"In the fall of 2002, she was seen by Dr. X.  He ordered an MRI scan of her brain and lumbar spine."
Neurology, He also did some sort of nerve testing and possibly visual evoked response testing.
Neurology," After reviewing everything, he diagnosed multiple sclerosis."
Neurology," However, prior to starting her on immunomodulatory therapy, he referred her for a second opinion to Dr. Y, in January of 2003."
Neurology, Dr. Y confirmed the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis.
Neurology,", The patient then returned to Dr. X and was started on Avonex."
Neurology, She continued on it for about six months.
Neurology," However, it made her feel much more stiff and delayed and so she finally stopped it."
Neurology," She also recalled being tried on baclofen by Dr. X, but again it did not benefit her and made her feel slightly dizzy."
Neurology," So, she discontinued it also."
Neurology,","
Neurology,"At that point in time, she decided to try a program of ""good nutrition, vitamin supplements, and fish oil"".,"
Neurology,"In December 2004 and extending up to February 2005, she began to note progressively more severe swelling and stiffness in the distal lower extremities."
Neurology, She began to have to use a cane.
Neurology, She was seen in neurological consultation by Dr. Z.  She was treated with a Medrol Dosepak.
Neurology, Her spasticity and swelling seemed to improve dramatically.
Neurology," However, within about two weeks symptoms were back to baseline."
Neurology,", She was then treated with intravenous Solu-Medrol 500 mg daily for five days followed by a prednisone or Medrol taper (July 2005)."
Neurology," This seemed to be less helpful than the oral steroids, but was partially beneficial."
Neurology," However, it wore off once again.,"
Neurology,"A repeat MRI scan of the brain in April 2005 was said to ""look better""."
Neurology, She was started on Zanaflex for her lower extremity spasticity without benefit.
Neurology,", Finally six days ago, she was restarted on oral prednisone 10 mg tablets."
Neurology, She takes one-half tablet daily and this again has seemed to reduce the swelling and stiffness in her legs.
Neurology, She continues on the prednisone in the same dosage for relief of the spasticity.
Neurology,", She has not been on any other immunomodulatory agents."
Neurology,", The patient does note some complaints of mild heat sensitivity and mild easy fatigability."
Neurology," There is no history of diplopia, dysarthria, aphasia, focal weakness, numbness, paresthesias, cognitive dysfunction, or memory dysfunction., PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: , Essentially noncontributory., ALLERGIES:,  The patient is allergic to LOBSTER and VICODIN."
Neurology," She feels that she is probably allergic to IODINE., SOCIAL HISTORY:,  She does not smoke."
Neurology," She takes one glass of wine per day., PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: , She has not had any prior surgeries."
Neurology, Her general health has been excellent except for the above-indicated problems.
Neurology,", REVIEW OF OUTSIDE RADIOLOGICAL STUDIES:,  The patient brought with her today MRI scans of the brain, thoracic spine, and lumbosacral spine performed on 11/14/02 on a 1.5-Tesla magnet."
Neurology, There are numerous T2 hyperintense lesions in the periventricular and subcortical white matter of the brain and at least one lesion is in the corpus callosum.
Neurology, There appear to be Dawson's fingers.
Neurology, The MRI of the thoracic and lumbosacral spines did not reveal any significant abnormalities.
Neurology,", Also available are the MRI scans of the brain, cervical spine, thoracic spine, and lumbosacral spine performed on a 0.35-Tesla magnet on 04/22/05."
Neurology," The MRI of the brain shows that one of the prior lesions has resolved and there appear to be one or two more lesions.,"
Neurology,"However, the quality of the newer scan is only 0.35-Tesla and is suboptimal."
Neurology," Visualization of the cord is also suboptimal, but there are no clear-cut extraaxial or complexities of the spinal cord."
Neurology," It is difficult to be certain that there are no intra-axial lesions, but I could not clearly see one., PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:, Vital signs:  Blood pressure 151/88, pulse 92, temperature 99.5ºF, and weight 124 lb (dressed)., General:  Well-developed, well-nourished female in no acute distress., Head:  Normocephalic, without evidence of trauma or bruits., Neck:  Supple, with full range of motion."

Neurology,", Strength in the lower extremities is rated as follows on a 5-point scale (right/left):  Iliopsoas 4+/5-, quadriceps 5-/5-, tibialis anterior 4+/4+, and gastrocnemius 5/5."
Neurology," There are no tremors, fasciculations or abnormal involuntary movements."
Neurology,"HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:, This is a 58-year-old male who reports a six to eight-week history of balance problems with fatigue and weakness."
Neurology,He has had several falls recently.
Neurology,He apparently had pneumonia 10 days prior to the onset of the symptoms.
Neurology,He took a course of amoxicillin for this.
Neurology,He complained of increased symptoms with more and more difficulty with coordination.
Neurology,"He fell at some point near the onset of the symptoms, but believes that his symptoms had occurred first."
Neurology,He fell from three to five feet and landed on his back.
Neurology,"He began seeing a chiropractor approximately five days ago and had adjustments of the neck and lumbar spine, although he clearly had symptoms prior to this.,"
Neurology,He has had mid and low back pain intermittently.
Neurology,He took a 10-day course of Cipro believing that he had a UTI.
Neurology,"He denies, however, any bowel or bladder problems."
Neurology,"There is no incontinence and he does not feel that he is having any difficulty voiding., PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:, He has a history of surgery on the left kidney, when it was ""rebuilt."""
Neurology,"He has had knee surgery, appendectomy and right inguinal hernia repair., MEDICATIONS:, His only home medications had been Cipro and Aleve."
Neurology,"However, he does take aspirin and several over the counter supplements including a multivitamin with iron, ""natural"" potassium, Starlix and the aspirin., ALLERGIES:, HE HAS NO KNOWN DRUG ALLERGIES., SOCIAL HISTORY:, He smokes one-and-one-half-packs of cigarettes per day and drinks alcohol at least several days per week."
Neurology,"He is employed in sales, which requires quite a bit of walking, but he is not doing any lifting."

Neurology,"He is afebrile., MENTAL STATUS: He is alert., CRANIAL NERVES:"
Neurology,His pupils were reactive to light.
Neurology,He had a dense left cataract present.
Neurology,The right disk margin appears sharp.
Neurology,His eye movements were full.
Neurology,The face was symmetric.
Neurology,Pain and temperature sensation were intact over both sides of the face.
Neurology,"The tongue was midline., NECK:"
Neurology,His neck was supple.
Neurology,", MUSCULOSKELETAL: He has intact strength and normal tone in the upper extremities."
Neurology,He had increased tone in both lower extremities.

Neurology,He had intact finger-to-nose testing.
Neurology,Marked impairment in heel-to-shin testing.
Neurology,He was able to sit unassisted.
Neurology,"He stood with assistance, but had a markedly ataxic gait."
Neurology,"On sensory exam, he had a slight distal gradient to pin and vibratory sense in both lower extremities, but also had a decrease in sensation to pin over the right lower extremity compared to the left."
Neurology,", CARDIOVASCULAR:"
Neurology,He had no carotid bruits.
Neurology,"His heart rhythm was regular.,"
Neurology,BACK: There was no focal back pain present.
Neurology,"He did have a slight sensory level at the upper T spine at approximately T3, both anteriorly and posteriorly., RADIOLOGIC DATA:, MRI by my view showed essentially unremarkable T spine."
Neurology,The MRI of his C spine showed significant spondylosis in the mid and lower C spine with spondylolisthesis at C7-T1.
Neurology,"There is an abnormal signal in the cord which begins at approximately this level, but descends approximately 2 cm."
Neurology,There is slight enhancement at the mid-portion of the lesion.
Neurology,"This appears to be an intrinsic lesion to the cord, not clearly associated with mild to moderate spinal stenosis at the level of the spondylolisthesis., LABORATORY: , His initial labs were unremarkable., IMPRESSION: , Cervical cord lesion at the C7 to T2 level of unclear etiology."
Neurology,"Consider a transverse myelitis, tumor, contusion or ischemic lesion., PLAN:, Will check labs including sedimentation rate, MRI of the brain, chest x-ray."
Neurology,He will probably need a lumbar puncture.
Neurology,"He also appears to have a mild peripheral neuropathy, which I suspect is an independent problem."
Neurology,We will request labs for this.
Neurology,"REASON FOR NEUROLOGICAL CONSULTATION: , Cervical spondylosis and kyphotic deformity."
Neurology," The patient was seen in conjunction with medical resident Dr. X. I personally obtained the history, performed examination, and generated the impression and plan., HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , The patient is a 45-year-old African-American female whose symptoms first started some one and a half years ago with pain in the left shoulder and some neck pain."
Neurology, This has subsequently resolved.
Neurology, She started vigorous workouts in November 2005.
Neurology," In March of this year, she suddenly could not feel her right foot on the bathroom floor and subsequently went to her primary care physician."
Neurology," By her report, she had a nerve conduction study and a diagnosis of radiculopathy was made."
Neurology," She had an MRI of lumbosacral spine, which was within normal limits."
Neurology, She then developed a tingling sensation in the right middle toe.
Neurology," Symptoms progressed to sensory symptoms of her knees, elbows, and left middle toe."
Neurology, She then started getting sensory sensations in the left hand and arm.
Neurology, She states that she feels a little bit wobbly at the knees and that she is slightly dragging her left leg.
Neurology, Symptoms have been mildly progressive.
Neurology, She is unaware of any trigger other than the vigorous workouts as mentioned above.
Neurology, She has no associated bowel or bladder symptoms.
Neurology, No particular position relieves her symptoms.
Neurology,", Workup has included two MRIs of the C-spine, which were personally reviewed and are discussed below."
Neurology, She saw you for consultation and the possibility of surgical decompression was raised.
Neurology," At this time, she is somewhat reluctant to go through any surgical procedure., PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:, 1."
Neurology," Ocular migraines., 2."
Neurology," Myomectomy., 3."
Neurology," Infertility., 4."
Neurology," Hyperglycemia., 5."
Neurology," Asthma., 6."
Neurology," Hypercholesterolemia., MEDICATIONS: , Lipitor, Pulmicort, Allegra, Xopenex, Patanol, Duac topical gel, Loprox cream, and Rhinocort., ALLERGIES: , Penicillin and aspirin., Family history, social history, and review of systems are discussed above as well as documented in the new patient information sheet."
Neurology," Of note, she does not drink or smoke."
Neurology, She is married with two adopted children.
Neurology, She is a paralegal specialist.
Neurology," She used to exercise vigorously, but of late has been advised to stop exercising and is currently only walking.,"
Neurology,"REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: , She does complain of mild blurred vision, but these have occurred before and seem associated with headaches., PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: , On examination, blood pressure 138/82, pulse 90, respiratory rate 14, and weight 176.5 pounds."
Neurology, Pain scale is 0.
Neurology, A full general and neurological examination was personally performed and is documented on the chart.
Neurology," Of note, she has a normal general examination."
Neurology, Neurological examination reveals normal cognition and cranial nerve examination including normal jaw jerk.
Neurology, She has mild postural tremor in both arms.
Neurology, She has mild decreased sensation in the right palm and mild decreased light touch in the right palm and decreased vibration sense in both distal lower extremities.
Neurology," Motor examination reveals no weakness to individual muscle testing, but on gait she does have a very subtle left hemiparesis."
Neurology," She has hyperreflexia in her lower extremities, worse on the left."
Neurology," Babinski's are downgoing., PERTINENT DATA:  , MRI of the brain from 05/02/06 and MRI of the C-spine from 05/02/06 and 07/25/06 were personally reviewed."
Neurology, MRI of the brain is broadly within normal limits.
Neurology, MRI of the C-spine reveals large central disc herniation at C6-C7 with evidence of mild cord compression and abnormal signal in the cord suggesting cord edema.
Neurology, There is also a fairly large disc at C3-C4 with cord deformity and partial effacement of the subarachnoid space.
Neurology," I do not appreciate any cord edema at this level., IMPRESSION AND PLAN:  , The patient is a 45-year-old female with cervical spondylosis with a large C6-C7 herniated disc with mild cord compression and signal change at that level."
Neurology, She has a small disc at C3-C4 with less severe and only subtle cord compression.
Neurology, History and examination are consistent with signs of a myelopathy.
Neurology,", Results were discussed with the patient and her mother."
Neurology, I am concerned about progressive symptoms.
Neurology," Although she only has subtle symptoms now, we made her aware that with progression of this process, she may have paralysis."
Neurology," If she is involved in any type of trauma to the neck such as motor vehicle accident, she could have an acute paralysis."
Neurology, I strongly recommended to her and her mother that she followup with you as soon as possible for surgical evaluation.
Neurology, I agree with the previous physicians who have told her not to exercise as I am sure that her vigorous workouts and weight training since November 2005 have contributed to this problem.
Neurology, I have recommended that she wear a hard collar while driving.
Neurology, The results of my consultation were discussed with you telephonically.
Neurology,"Doctor's Address, Dear Doctor:, This letter serves as an introduction to my patient, A, who will be seeing you in the near future."
Neurology, He is a pleasant young man who has a diagnosis of bulbar cerebral palsy and hypotonia.
Neurology, He has been treated by Dr. X through the pediatric neurology clinic.
Neurology," He saw Dr. X recently and she noted that he was having difficulty with mouth breathing, which was contributing to some of his speech problems."
Neurology, She also noted and confirmed that he has significant tonsillar hypertrophy.
Neurology, The concern we have is whether he may benefit from surgery to remove his tonsils and improve his mouth breathing and his swallowing and speech.
Neurology," Therefore, I ask for your opinion on this matter.,"
Neurology,"For his chronic allergic rhinitis symptoms, he is currently on Flonase two sprays to each nostril once a day."
Neurology, He also has been taking Zyrtec 10 mg a day with only partial relief of the symptoms.
Neurology, He does have an allergy to penicillin.
Neurology,", I appreciate your input on his care."
Neurology," If you have any questions regarding, please feel free to call me through my office."
Neurology," Otherwise, I look forward to hearing back from you regarding his evaluation."
Neurology,"CC: , Headache (HA), HX:, 10 y/o RHM awoke with a bilateral parieto-occipital HA associated with single episode of nausea and vomiting, 2 weeks prior to presentation."
Neurology,The nausea and vomiting resolved and did not recur.
Neurology,"However, he continued to experience similar HA 3-4 times per week during the early morning upon awakening."
Neurology,He never felt the HA awakened him from sleep.
Neurology,"The HA were partially relieved by Tylenol or Advil, and he distracted himself from the pain by remaining active."
Neurology,"One week prior to presentation, he started to experience short episodes of blurred vision and diplopia."
Neurology,"He also became fatigued, less active, and frequently yawned."
Neurology,", He had no prior history of HA and he and his family denied any sign or symptom of focal weakness or numbness, dysphagia, dysarthria, or loss of consciousness.,"
Neurology,The patient underwent an MRI brain scan prior to transfer to UIHC.
Neurology,This revealed a mass in the left frontal region adjacent to the left temporal horn.
Neurology,"The mass was an inhomogeneous blend of signals on T1 and T2 images giving a suggestion of acute bleeding, hemosiderin deposition and multiple vessels within the mass., MEDS:, None., PMH:, 1)"

Neurology,He underwent cerebral angiography on 1/25/93.
Neurology,"Upon injection of the RCCA an avascular mass was identified in the right temporal lobe displacing the anterior choroidal artery, and temporal branches of the middle cerebral arteries."
Neurology,The internal cerebral vein is displaced to the left suggesting mass effect.
Neurology,There is a hypoplastic A1 segment and fetal origin of the LPCA.
Neurology,"The mass was felt by neuroradiology to represent a hematoma.,"
Neurology,"He underwent a right frontal craniotomy, 1/28/93."
Neurology,Pathological evaluation of the resected tissue was consistent with a vascular malformation with inclusive reactive glial tissue and evidence of recurrent and remote hemorrhage.
Neurology,"There were dilated vascular channels having walls of variable thickness, but without evidence of elastic lamina by elastic staining."
Neurology,This was consistent with venous angioma/malformation.

Neurology,"XYZ, RE:  ABC, MEDICAL RECORD#:  123, Dear Dr. XYZ:, I saw ABC back in Neuro-Oncology Clinic today."
Neurology," He comes in for an urgent visit because of increasing questions about what to do next for his anaplastic astrocytoma.,"
Neurology,"Within the last several days, he has seen you in clinic and once again discussed whether or not to undergo radiation for his left temporal lesion."
Neurology, The patient has clearly been extremely ambivalent about this therapy for reasons that are not immediately apparent.
Neurology, It is clear that his MRI is progressing and that it seems unlikely at this time that anything other than radiation would be particularly effective.
Neurology," Despite repeatedly emphasizing this; however, the patient still is worried about potential long-term side effects from treatment that frankly seem unwarranted at this particular time."
Neurology,", After seeing you in clinic, he and his friend again wanted to discuss possible changes in the chemotherapy regimen."
Neurology, They came in with a list of eight possible agents that they would like to be administered within the next two weeks.
Neurology," They then wanted another MRI to be performed and they were hoping that with the use of this type of approach, they might be able to induce another remission from which he can once again be spared radiation.,"
Neurology,"From my view, I noticed a man whose language has deteriorated in the week since I last saw him."
Neurology, This is very worrisome.
Neurology," Today, for the first time, I felt that there was a definite right facial droop as well."
Neurology," Therefore, there is no doubt that he is becoming symptomatic from his growing tumor."
Neurology," It suggests that he is approaching the end of his compliance curve and that the things may rapidly deteriorate in the near future.,"
Neurology,"Emphasizing this once again, in addition, to recommending steroids I once again tried to convince him to undergo radiation."
Neurology," Despite an hour, this again amazingly was not possible."
Neurology," It is not that he does not want treatment, however."
Neurology," Because I told him that I did not feel it was ethical to just put him on the radical regimen that him and his friend devised, we compromised and elected to go back to Temodar in a low dose daily type regimen."

Gastroenterology,"Preoperatively, 1 gram of Ancef was given."
Gastroenterology,The abdomen was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.
Gastroenterology,"After anesthesia was achieved, an endoscope was placed down into the stomach, and no abnormalities were noted."
Gastroenterology,The stomach was insufflated with air and the endoscope was positioned in the midportion and directed towards the anterior abdominal wall.
Gastroenterology,"With the room darkened and intensity turned up on the endoscope, a light reflex was noted on the skin of the abdominal wall in the left upper quadrant at approximately 2 fingerbreadths inferior from the most inferior rib."
Gastroenterology,Finger pressure was applied to the light reflex with adequate indentation on the stomach wall on endoscopy.
Gastroenterology,"A 21-gauge 1-1/2 inch needle was initially placed at the margin of the light reflex, and this was done twice."
Gastroenterology,Both times it was not visualized on the endoscopy.
Gastroenterology,"At this point, repositioning was made and, again, what was felt to be adequate light reflex was obtained, and the 14-gauge angio catheter was placed."
Gastroenterology,"Again, after two attempts, we were unable to visualize the needle in the stomach endoscopically."
Gastroenterology,"At this point, decision was made to convert the procedure to an open Stamm gastrostomy."
Gastroenterology,", OPEN STAMM GASTROSTOMY: , A short upper midline incision was made and deepened through the subcutaneous tissues."
Gastroenterology,Hemostasis was achieved with electrocautery.
Gastroenterology,"The linea alba was identified and incised, and the peritoneal cavity was entered."
Gastroenterology,The abdomen was explored.
Gastroenterology,Adhesions were lysed with electrocautery under direct vision.
Gastroenterology,"The stomach was identified, and a location on the anterior wall near the greater curvature was selected."
Gastroenterology,"After lysis of adhesions was confirmed, we sufficiently moved the original chosen site without tension."
Gastroenterology,"A pursestring suture of #3-0 silk was placed on the interior surface of the stomach, and a second #3-0 pursestring silk stitch was placed exterior to that pursestring suture."
Gastroenterology,An incision was then made at the location of the anterior wall which was near the greater curvature and was dissected down to the anterior abdominal wall.
Gastroenterology,A Vanderbilt was used to pass through the abdominal wall in through the skin and then returned to the level of the skin and pulled the Bard feeding tube through the anterior wall into the field.
Gastroenterology,An incision in the center of the pursestring suture on the anterior surface of the stomach was then made with electrocautery.
Gastroenterology,The interior pursestring suture was sutured into place in such a manner as to inkwell the stomach around the catheter.
Gastroenterology,The second outer concentric pursestring suture was then secured as well and tied to further inkwell the stomach.
Gastroenterology,The stomach was then tacked to the anterior abdominal wall at the catheter entrance site with four #2-0 silk sutures in such a manner as to prevent leakage or torsion.
Gastroenterology,The catheter was then secured to the skin with two #2-0 silk sutures.
Gastroenterology,Hemostasis was checked and the peritoneal cavity was washed out and brought to the surgical field.
Gastroenterology,"Prior to the initiation of the gastrotomy, the bowel was run and at that time there was noted to be one incidental colotomy."
Gastroenterology,This was oversewn with three #4-0 silk Lembert sutures.

Gastroenterology," His buttocks were taped, prepped and draped in a sterile fashion."
Gastroenterology, The anterior rectal wall was exposed using a Parks anal retractor.
Gastroenterology, The entire wound was visualized with a few rotations of the retractor and a few sites along the edges were seen to be oozing and were touched up with cautery.
Gastroenterology, There was one spot in the corner that was oozing and this may have been from simply opening the retractor enough to see well.
Gastroenterology, This was controlled with a 3-0 Monocryl figure-of-eight suture.
Gastroenterology," At the completion, there was no bleeding, no oozing, it was completely dry, and we removed our retractor, and the patient was then turned and extubated and taken to the recovery room in stable condition."
Gastroenterology,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Protein-calorie malnutrition., POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Protein-calorie malnutrition.,"
Gastroenterology,"PROCEDURE PERFORMED:, Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube., ANESTHESIA: , Conscious sedation per Anesthesia., SPECIMEN: , None., COMPLICATIONS: , None., HISTORY:  , The patient is a 73-year-old male who was admitted to the hospital with some mentation changes."
Gastroenterology, He was unable to sustain enough caloric intake and had markedly decreased albumin stores.
Gastroenterology," After discussion with the patient and the son, they agreed to place a PEG tube for nutritional supplementation.,"
Gastroenterology,"PROCEDURE: , After informed consent was obtained, the patient was brought to the endoscopy suite."
Gastroenterology, He was placed in the supine position and was given IV sedation by the Anesthesia Department.
Gastroenterology, An EGD was performed from above by Dr. X.  The stomach was transilluminated and an optimal position for the PEG tube was identified using the single poke method.
Gastroenterology, The skin was infiltrated with local and the needle and sheath were inserted through the abdomen into the stomach under direct visualization.
Gastroenterology, The needle was removed and a guidewire was inserted through the sheath.
Gastroenterology, The guidewire was grasped from above with a snare by the endoscopist.
Gastroenterology, It was removed completely and the Ponsky PEG tube was secured to the guidewire.
Gastroenterology,", The guidewire and PEG tube were then pulled through the mouth and esophagus and snug to the abdominal wall."
Gastroenterology, There was no evidence of bleeding.
Gastroenterology, Photos were taken.
Gastroenterology, The Bolster was placed on the PEG site.
Gastroenterology, A complete dictation for the EGD will be done separately by Dr. X.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to recovery room in stable condition.
Gastroenterology, He will be started on tube feedings in 6 hours with aspiration precautions and dietary to determine his nutritional goal.
Gastroenterology,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Abdominal mass., POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Abdominal mass., PROCEDURE:,  Paracentesis., DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  , This 64-year-old female has stage II endometrial carcinoma, which had been resected before and treated with chemotherapy and radiation."
Gastroenterology," At the present time, the patient is under radiation treatment."
Gastroenterology," Two weeks ago or so, she developed a large abdominal mass, which was cystic in nature and the radiologist inserted a pigtail catheter in the emergency room."
Gastroenterology, We proceeded to admit the patient and drained a significant amount of clear fluid in the subsequent days.
Gastroenterology, The cytology of the fluid was negative and the culture was also negative.
Gastroenterology," Eventually, the patient was sent home with the pigtail shut off and the patient a week later underwent a repeat CAT scan of the abdomen and pelvis."
Gastroenterology,", The CAT scan showed accumulation of the fluid and the mass almost achieving 80% of the previous size."
Gastroenterology," Therefore, I called the patient home"
Gastroenterology,and she came to the emergency department where the service was provided.
Gastroenterology," At that time, I proceeded to work on the pigtail catheter after obtaining an informed consent and preparing and draping the area in the usual fashion."
Gastroenterology," Unfortunately, the catheter was open."
Gastroenterology, I did not have a drainage system at that time.
Gastroenterology," So, I withdrew directly with a syringe 700 mL of clear fluid."
Gastroenterology," The system was connected to the draining bag, and the patient was instructed to keep a log and how to use equipment."
Gastroenterology," She was given an appointment to see me in the office next Monday, which is three days from now."
Gastroenterology,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Acute acalculous cholecystitis., POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Acute hemorrhagic cholecystitis., PROCEDURE PERFORMED: , Open cholecystectomy., ANESTHESIA: , Epidural with local., COMPLICATIONS: , None., DISPOSITION: , The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to recovery in stable condition., SPECIMEN:  , Gallbladder., BRIEF HISTORY:  , The patient is a 73-year-old female who presented to ABCD General Hospital on 07/23/2003 secondary to a fall at home from which the patient suffered a right shoulder as well as hip fracture."
Gastroenterology, The patient subsequently went to the operating room on 07/25/2003 for a right hip hemiarthroplasty per the Orthopedics Department.
Gastroenterology," Subsequently, the patient was doing well postoperatively, however, the patient does have severe O2 and steroid-dependent COPD and at an extreme risk for any procedure."
Gastroenterology, The patient began developing abdominal pain over the course of the next several days and a consultation was requested on 08/07/2003 for surgical evaluation for upper abdominal pain.
Gastroenterology," During the evaluation, the patient was found to have an acute acalculous cholecystitis in which nonoperative management was opted for and on 08/08/03, the patient underwent a percutaneous cholecystostomy tube placement to drain the gallbladder."
Gastroenterology, The patient did well postdrainage.
Gastroenterology, The patient's laboratory values and biliary values returned to normal and the patient was planned for a removal of the tube with 48 hours of the tubing clamp.
Gastroenterology," However, once the tube was removed, the patient re-obstructed with recurrent symptoms and a second tube was needed to be placed; this was done on 08/16/2003."
Gastroenterology," A HIDA scan had been performed, which showed no cystic duct obstruction."
Gastroenterology," A tube cholecystogram was performed, which showed no cystic or common duct obstruction."
Gastroenterology," There was abnormal appearance of the gallbladder, however, the pathway was patent."
Gastroenterology," Thus after failure of two nonoperative management therapies, extensive discussions were made with the family and the patient's only option was to undergo a cholecystectomy."
Gastroenterology," Initial thoughts were to do a laparoscopic cholecystectomy, however, with the patient's severe COPD and risk for ventilator management, the options were an epidural and an open cholecystectomy under local was made and to be performed., INTRAOPERATIVE FINDINGS:  , The patient's gallbladder had some patchy and necrosis areas."
Gastroenterology, There were particular changes on the serosal surface as well as on the mucosal surface with multiple clots within the gallbladder.
Gastroenterology," The patient also had no plane between the gallbladder and the liver bed., OPERATIVE PROCEDURE: , After informed written consent, risks and benefits of the procedure were explained to the patient and discussed with the patient's family."
Gastroenterology, The patient was brought to the operating room after an epidural was performed per anesthesia.
Gastroenterology, Local anesthesia was given with 1% lidocaine.
Gastroenterology, A paramedian incision was made approximately 5 cm in length with a #15 blade scalpel.
Gastroenterology," Next, hemostasis was obtained using electro Bovie cautery."
Gastroenterology," Dissection was carried down transrectus in the midline to the posterior rectus fascia, which was grasped with hemostats and entered with a #10 blade scalpel."
Gastroenterology," Next, Metzenbaum scissors were used to extend the incision and the abdomen was entered ."
Gastroenterology," The gallbladder was immediately visualized and brought up into view, grasped with two ring clamps elevating the biliary tree into view."
Gastroenterology," Dissection with a ______ was made to identify the cystic artery and cystic duct, which were both easily identified."
Gastroenterology," The cystic artery was clipped, two distal and one proximal to the gallbladder cutting between with Metzenbaum scissors."
Gastroenterology, The cystic duct was identified.
Gastroenterology, A silk tie #3-0 silk was placed one distal and one proximal with #3-0 silk and then cutting in between with a Metzenbaum scissors.
Gastroenterology, The gallbladder was then removed from the liver bed using electro Bovie cautery.
Gastroenterology, A plane was created.
Gastroenterology, The hemostasis was obtained using the electro Bovie cautery as well as some Surgicel.
Gastroenterology," The gallbladder was then removed as specimen, sent to pathology for frozen sections for diagnosis, of which the hemorrhagic cholecystitis was diagnosed on frozen sections."
Gastroenterology, Permanent sections are still pending.
Gastroenterology, The remainder of the fossa was hemostatic with the Surgicel and attention was next made to closing the abdomen.
Gastroenterology, The peritoneum as well as posterior rectus fascia was approximated with a running #0 Vicryl suture and then the anterior rectus fascia was closed in interrupted figure-of-eight #0 Vicryl sutures.
Gastroenterology, Skin staples were used on the skin and sterile dressings were applied and the patient was transferred to recovery in stable condition.
Gastroenterology,"PROCEDURE PERFORMED: , Nissen fundoplication., DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: , After informed consent was obtained detailing the risks of infection, bleeding, esophageal perforation and death, the patient was brought to the operative suite and placed supine on the operating room table."
Gastroenterology, General endotracheal anesthesia was induced without incident.
Gastroenterology, The patient was then placed in a modified lithotomy position taking great care to pad all extremities.
Gastroenterology, TEDs and Venodynes were placed as prophylaxis against deep venous thrombosis.
Gastroenterology, Antibiotics were given for prophylaxis against surgical infection.
Gastroenterology,", A 52-French bougie was placed in the proximal esophagus by Anesthesia, above the cardioesophageal junction."
Gastroenterology, A 2 cm midline incision was made at the junction of the upper two-thirds and lower one-third between the umbilicus and the xiphoid process.
Gastroenterology, The fascia was then cleared of subcutaneous tissue using a tonsil clamp.
Gastroenterology, A 1-2 cm incision was then made in the fascia gaining entry into the abdominal cavity without incident.
Gastroenterology," Two sutures of 0 Vicryl were then placed superiorly and inferiorly in the fascia, and then tied to the special 12 mm Hasson trocar fitted with a funnel-shaped adaptor in order to occlude the fascial opening."
Gastroenterology, Pneumoperitoneum was then established using carbon dioxide insufflation to a steady state of pressure of 16 mmHg.
Gastroenterology, A 30-degree laparoscope was inserted through this port and used to guide the remaining trocars.
Gastroenterology,", The remaining trocars were then placed into the abdomen taking care to make the incisions along Langer's line, spreading the subcutaneous tissue with a tonsil clamp, and confirming the entry site by depressing the abdominal wall prior to insertion of the trocar."
Gastroenterology, A total of 4 other 10/11 mm trocars were placed.
Gastroenterology," Under direct vision 1 was inserted in the right upper quadrant at the midclavicular line, at a right supraumbilical position; another at the left upper quadrant at the midclavicular line, at a left supraumbilical position; 1 under the right costal margin in the anterior axillary line; and another laterally under the left costal margin on the anterior axillary line."
Gastroenterology, All of the trocars were placed without difficulty.
Gastroenterology, The patient was then placed in reverse Trendelenburg position.
Gastroenterology,", The triangular ligament was taken down sharply, and the left lobe of the liver was retracted superolaterally using a fan retractor placed through the right lateral cannula."
Gastroenterology, The gastrohepatic ligament was then identified and incised in an avascular plane.
Gastroenterology, The dissection was carried anteromedially onto the phrenoesophageal membrane.
Gastroenterology, The phrenoesophageal membrane was divided on the anterior aspect of the hiatal orifice.
Gastroenterology, This incision was extended to the right to allow identification of the right crus.
Gastroenterology," Then along the inner side of the crus, the right esophageal wall was freed by dissecting the cleavage plane.,"
Gastroenterology,The liberation of the posterior aspect of the esophagus was started by extending the dissection the length of the right diaphragmatic crus.
Gastroenterology," The pars flaccida of the lesser omentum was opened, preserving the hepatic branches of the vagus nerve."
Gastroenterology," This allowed free access to the crura, left and right, and the right posterior aspect of the esophagus, and the posterior vagus nerve., Attention was next turned to the left anterolateral aspect of the esophagus."
Gastroenterology," At its left border, the left crus was identified."
Gastroenterology, The dissection plane between it and the left aspect of the esophagus was freed.
Gastroenterology," The gastrophrenic ligament was incised, beginning the mobilization of the gastric pouch."
Gastroenterology," By dissecting the intramediastinal portion of the esophagus, we elongated the intra-abdominal segment of the esophagus and reduced the hiatal hernia.,"
Gastroenterology,The next step consisted of mobilization of the gastric pouch.
Gastroenterology, This required ligation and division of the gastrosplenic ligament and several short gastric vessels using the harmonic scalpel.
Gastroenterology," This dissection started on the stomach at the point where the vessels of the greater curvature turned towards the spleen, away from the gastroepiploic arcade."
Gastroenterology, The esophagus was lifted by a Babcock inserted through the left upper quadrant port.
Gastroenterology, Careful dissection of the mesoesophagus and the left crus revealed a cleavage plane between the crus and the posterior gastric wall.
Gastroenterology, Confirmation of having opened the correct plane was obtained by visualizing the spleen behind the esophagus.
Gastroenterology, A one-half inch Penrose drain was inserted around the esophagus and sewn to itself in order to facilitate retraction of the distal esophagus.
Gastroenterology, The retroesophageal channel was enlarged to allow easy passage of the antireflux valve.
Gastroenterology,", The 52-French bougie was then carefully lowered into the proximal stomach, and the hiatal orifice was repaired."
Gastroenterology," Two interrupted 0 silk sutures were placed in the diaphragmatic crura to close the orifice.,"
Gastroenterology,The last part of the operation consisted of the passage and fixation of the antireflux valve.
Gastroenterology," With anterior retraction on the esophagus using the Penrose drain, a Babcock was passed behind the esophagus, from right to left."
Gastroenterology," It was used to grab the gastric pouch to the left of the esophagus and to pull it behind, forming the wrap."
Gastroenterology," The, 52-French bougie was used to calibrate the external ring."
Gastroenterology, Marcaine 0.5% was injected 1 fingerbreadth anterior to the anterior superior iliac spine and around the wound for postanesthetic pain control.
Gastroenterology, The skin incision was approximated with skin staples.
Gastroenterology, A dressing was then applied.
Gastroenterology," All surgical counts were reported as correct.,"
Gastroenterology,"Having tolerated the procedure well, the patient was subsequently taken to the recovery room in good and stable condition."
Gastroenterology,"PRESENTATION: , A 16-year-old male presents to the emergency department (ED) with rectal bleeding and pain on defecation., HISTORY:,  A 16-year-old African American male presents to the ED with a chief complaint of rectal bleeding and pain on defecation."
Gastroenterology, The patient states that he was well until about three days prior to presentation when he first started to experience some pain when defecating.
Gastroenterology, The following day he noted increasing pain and first noted blood on the surface of his stool.
Gastroenterology, The pain worsened on the subsequent day with increasing bleeding as well as some mucopurulent anal discharge.
Gastroenterology, The patient denies any previous history of rectal bleeding or pain.
Gastroenterology, He also denies any previous sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) and states that he was screened for HIV infection eight months ago and was negative.
Gastroenterology, The patient does state that he has not felt well for the past week.
Gastroenterology," He states that he had felt ""feverish"" on several occasions but has not taken his temperature."
Gastroenterology, He has also complained of some abdominal discomfort with nausea and diarrhea as well as generalized myalgias and fatigue.
Gastroenterology," He thinks he has lost a few pounds but has not been weighing himself to determine the exact amount of weight loss.,"
Gastroenterology,The patient states that he has been sexually active since age 13.
Gastroenterology," He admits to eight previous partners and states that he ""usually"" uses a condom."
Gastroenterology," On further questioning, the patient states that of his eight partners, three were female and five were male."
Gastroenterology, His most recent sexual partner was a 38-year-old man whom he has been with for the past six months.
Gastroenterology, He states that he has been tested for STDs in the past but states that he only gave urine and blood for the testing.
Gastroenterology, He is unaware of the HIV status of his partner but assumes that the partner is uninfected because he looks healthy.
Gastroenterology, The patient also admits to one episode of sexual abuse at the age of 8 by a friend of the family.
Gastroenterology," As the man was a member of the family's church, the patient never felt comfortable disclosing this to any of the adults in his life."
Gastroenterology," He is very concerned about disclosure of his sexual behavior to his family, as they have expressed very negative comments concerning men who have sex with men."
Gastroenterology," He is accessing care in the ED unaccompanied by an adult., PHYSICAL EXAM: , Thin but non-toxic young man with clear discomfort.,"
Gastroenterology,"Pulse = 105, RR = 23, BP = 120/62, HEENT:"
Gastroenterology," Several areas of white plaque-like material on the buccal mucosa., Neck:  Multiple anterior/posterior cervical nodes in both anterior and posterior chains- 1-2 cm in diameter., Lungs:  Clear to auscultation., Cardiac:  Quiet precordium., Nl S1/S2 with a II/VI systolic murmur."
Gastroenterology,", Abdomen:  Soft without hepatosplenomegaly., GU:  Tanner V male with no external penile lesions., Lymph:  2-3 cm axillary nodes bilaterally., 1-2 cm epitrochlear nodes.,"
Gastroenterology,"Multiple 1-2 cm inguinal nodes.,"
Gastroenterology,Rectal:  Extremely painful digital exam.
Gastroenterology,",+ gross blood and mucous., LABORATORY EVALUATION:, Hbg = 12."
Gastroenterology," 5 gm/dL, Hct = 32%, WBC = 3.9 thou/µL, Platelets = 120, 000 thou/µL, 76% neutrophils, 19% lymphocytes, 1% eosinophils, 4% monocytes, ALT ="
Gastroenterology,"82 U/L, AST= 90 U/L, Erythrocyte sedimentation rate = 90, Electrolytes = normal, Gram stain of anal swab:  numerous WBCs, DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS: , This patient is presenting with acute rectal pain with bleeding and anal discharge."
Gastroenterology," The patient also presents with some constitutional symptoms including fever, fatigue, abdominal discomfort, and adenopathy on physical examination."
Gastroenterology," The following are in the differential diagnosis:  Acute Proctitis and  Proctocolitis., ACUTE HIV SEROCONVERSION: , This subject is sexually active and reports inconsistent condom use."
Gastroenterology, Gastrointestinal symptoms have recently been reported commonly in patients with a history of HIV seroconversion.
Gastroenterology," The rectal symptoms of bleeding and pain are not common with HIV, and an alternative diagnosis would be required., PERIRECTAL ABSCESS: , A patient with a history of receptive anal intercourse is at risk for developing a perirectal abscess either from trauma or a concurrent STD."
Gastroenterology," The patient could experience more systemic symptoms with fever and malaise, as found with this patient."
Gastroenterology," However, the physical examination did not reveal the typical localized area of pain and edema., DIAGNOSIS:  , The subject had rectal cultures obtained, which were positive for Neisseria gonorrhoeae."
Gastroenterology," An HIV ELISA was positive, as was the RNA PCR., DISCUSSION: , This patient demonstrates a number of key issues to consider when caring for an adolescent or young adult."
Gastroenterology," First, the patient utilized the emergency department for care as opposed to identifying a primary care provider."
Gastroenterology," Although not ideal in many circumstances, testing for HIV infection is crucial when there is suspicion, since many newly diagnosed patients identify earlier contacts with health care providers when HIV counseling and testing were not performed."
Gastroenterology," Second, this young man has had both male and female sexual partners."
Gastroenterology," As young people explore their sexuality, asking about partners in an open, nonjudgmental manner without applying labels is integral to helping the young person discuss their sexual behaviors."
Gastroenterology, Assuming heterosexuality is a major barrier to disclosure for many young people who have same-sex attractions.
Gastroenterology," Third, screening for STDs must take into account sexual behaviors."
Gastroenterology," Although urine-based screening has expanded testing of young people, it misses anal and pharyngeal infections."
Gastroenterology," If a young person is only having receptive oral or anal intercourse, urine screening is insufficient to rule out STDs."
Gastroenterology," Fourth, this young man had both localized and systemic symptoms."
Gastroenterology," As his anal symptoms were most suggestive of a current STD, performing an HIV test should be part of the standard evaluation."
Gastroenterology," In addition, as acute infection is on the differential diagnosis, PCR testing should also be considered."
Gastroenterology, The care provided to this young man included the following.
Gastroenterology, He was treated presumptively for proctitis with both IM ceftriaxone as well as oral doxycycline to treat N gonorrhoeae and C trachomatis.
Gastroenterology, Ceftriaxone was chosen due to the recent reports of resistant N gonorrhoeae.
Gastroenterology," At the time of the diagnosis, the young man was given the opportunity to meet with the case manager from the adolescent-specific HIV program."
Gastroenterology, The case manager linked this young man directly to care after providing brief counseling and support.
Gastroenterology, The case manager maintained contact with the young man until his first clinical visit four days later.
Gastroenterology," Over the subsequent three months, the young man had two sets of laboratory testing to stage his HIV infection.,"
Gastroenterology,"Set #1 CD4 T-lymphocyte count = 225 cells/mm3, 15% , Quantitative RNA PCR = 75, 000 copies/mL"
Gastroenterology,"HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: ,  The patient is a 48-year-old man who has had abdominal pain since October of last year associated with a 30-pound weight loss and then developed jaundice."
Gastroenterology, He had epigastric pain and was admitted to the hospital.
Gastroenterology," A thin-slice CT scan was performed, which revealed a 4 x 3 x 2 cm pancreatic mass with involved lymph nodes and ring enhancing lesions consistent with liver metastases."
Gastroenterology," The patient, additionally, had a questionable pseudocyst in the tail of the pancreas."
Gastroenterology, The patient underwent ERCP on 04/04/2007 with placement of a stent.
Gastroenterology," This revealed a strictured pancreatic duct, as well as strictured bile duct."
Gastroenterology, A 10-french x 9 cm stent was placed with good drainage.
Gastroenterology," The next morning, the patient felt quite a bit more comfortable."
Gastroenterology, He additionally had a modest drop in his bilirubin and other liver tests.
Gastroenterology," Of note, the patient has been having quite a bit of nausea during his admission."
Gastroenterology, This responded to Zofran.
Gastroenterology," It did not, initially, respond well to Phenergan, though after stent placement, he was significantly more comfortable and had less nausea, and in fact, had better response to the Phenergan itself."
Gastroenterology," At the time of discharge, the patient's white count was 9.4, hemoglobin 10.8, hematocrit 32 with a MCV of 79, platelet count of 585, 000."
Gastroenterology," His sodium was 132, potassium 4.1, chloride 95, CO2 27, BUN of 8 with a creatinine of 0.3."
Gastroenterology," His bilirubin was 17.1, alk phos 273, AST 104, ALT 136, total protein 7.8 and albumin of 3.8."
Gastroenterology, He was tolerating a regular diet.
Gastroenterology," The patient had been on oral hypoglycemics as an outpatient, but in hospital, he was simply managed with an insulin sliding scale."
Gastroenterology," The patient will be transferred back to Pelican Bay, under the care of Dr. X at the infirmary."
Gastroenterology, He will be further managed for his diabetes there.
Gastroenterology, The patient will additionally undergo potential end of life meetings.
Gastroenterology, I discussed the potentials of chemotherapy with patient.
Gastroenterology," Certainly, there are modest benefits, which can be obtained with chemotherapy in metastatic pancreatic cancer, though at some cost with morbidity."
Gastroenterology," The patient will consider this and will discuss this further with Dr. X.  , DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:, 1."
Gastroenterology, Phenergan 25 mg q.6.
Gastroenterology,"p.r.n., 2."
Gastroenterology," Duragesic patch 100 mcg q.3.d., 3."
Gastroenterology, Benadryl 25-50 mg p.o. q.i.d.
Gastroenterology,"for pruritus., 4."
Gastroenterology," Sliding scale will be discontinued at the time of discharge and will be reinstituted on arrival at Pelican Bay Infirmary., 5."
Gastroenterology, The patient had initially been on enalapril here.
Gastroenterology, His hypertension will be managed by Dr. X as well.
Gastroenterology," , PLAN: , The patient should return for repeat ERCP if there are signs of stent occlusion such as fever, increased bilirubin, worsening pain."
Gastroenterology," In the meantime, he will be kept on a regular diet and activity per Dr. X."
Gastroenterology,"HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , The patient is a 55-year-old Hispanic male who was seen initially in the office February 15, 2006, with epigastric and right upper quadrant abdominal pain, nausea, dizziness, and bloating."
Gastroenterology, The patient at that time stated that he had established diagnosis of liver cirrhosis.
Gastroenterology," Since the last visit the patient was asked to sign a lease of information form and we sent request for information from the doctor the patient saw before, Dr. X in Las Cruces and his primary care physician in Silver City, and unfortunately we did not get any information from anybody."
Gastroenterology," Also the patient had admission in Gila Medical Center with epigastric pain, diarrhea, and confusion."
Gastroenterology, He spent 3 days in the hospital.
Gastroenterology, He was followed by Dr. X and unfortunately we also do not have the information of what was wrong with the patient.
Gastroenterology, From the patient's report he was diagnosed with some kind of viral infection.
Gastroenterology," At the time of admission he had a lot of epigastric pain, nausea, vomiting, fever, and chills., PHYSICAL EXAMINATION, VITAL SIGNS:  Weight 107, height 6 feet 1 inch, blood pressure 128/67, heart rate 74, saturation 98%; pain is 3/10 with localization of the pain in the epigastric area., HEENT:  PERRLA."
Gastroenterology, EOM intact.
Gastroenterology," Oropharynx is clear of lesions., NECK:  Supple."
Gastroenterology, No lymphadenopathy.
Gastroenterology," No thyromegaly., LUNGS:  Clear to auscultation and percussion bilateral."
Gastroenterology,", CARDIOVASCULAR:  Regular rate and rhythm."
Gastroenterology," No murmurs, rubs, or gallops., ABDOMEN:  Not tender, not distended."
Gastroenterology, Splenomegaly about 4 cm under the costal margin.
Gastroenterology, No hepatomegaly.
Gastroenterology," Bowel sounds present., MUSCULOSKELETAL:  No cyanosis, no clubbing, no pitting edema."
Gastroenterology,", NEUROLOGIC:  Nonfocal."
Gastroenterology, No asterixis.
Gastroenterology," No costovertebral tenderness., PSYCHE:  The patient is oriented x4, alert and cooperative., LABORATORY DATA: , We were able to collect lab results from Medical Center; we got only CMP from the hospital which showed glucose level 79, BUN 9, creatinine 0.6, sodium 136, potassium 3.5, chloride 104, CO2 23.7, calcium 7.3, total protein 5.9, albumin 2.5, total bilirubin 5.63."
Gastroenterology," His AST 56, ALT 37, alkaline phosphatase 165, and his ammonia level was 53."
Gastroenterology, We do not have any other results back.
Gastroenterology, No hepatitis panels.
Gastroenterology, No alpha-fetoprotein level.
Gastroenterology," The patient told me today that he also got an ultrasound of the abdomen and the result was not impressive, but we do not have this result despite calling medical records in the hospital to release this information.,"
Gastroenterology,"ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:,  The patient is a 55-year-old with established diagnosis of liver cirrhosis, unknown cause., 1."
Gastroenterology, Epigastric pain.
Gastroenterology," The patient had chronic pain syndrome, he had multiple back surgeries, and he has taken opiate for a prolonged period of time."
Gastroenterology, In the office twice the patient did not have any abdominal pain on physical exam.
Gastroenterology, His pain does not sound like obstruction of common bile duct and he had these episodes of abdominal pain almost continuously.
Gastroenterology," He probably requires increased level of pain control with increased dose of opiates, which should be addressed with his primary care physician., 2."
Gastroenterology, End-stage liver disease.
Gastroenterology," Of course, we need to find out the cause of the liver cirrhosis."
Gastroenterology, We do not have hepatitis panel yet and we do not have information about the liver biopsy which was performed before.
Gastroenterology, We do not have any information of any type of investigation in the past.
Gastroenterology," Again, patient was seen by gastroenterologist already in Las Cruces, Dr. X.  The patient was advised to contact Dr. X by himself to convince him to send available information because we already send release information form signed by the patient without any result."
Gastroenterology, It will be not reasonable to repeat unnecessary tests in that point in time.
Gastroenterology,", We are waiting for the hepatitis panel and alpha-fetoprotein level."
Gastroenterology," We will also need to get information about ultrasound which was done in Gila Medical Center, but obviously no tumor was found on this exam of the liver."
Gastroenterology," We have to figure out hepatitis status for another reason if he needs vaccination against hepatitis A and B.  Until now we do not know exactly what the cause of the patient's end-stage liver disease is and my differential diagnosis probably is hepatitis C.  The patient denied any excessive alcohol intake, but I could not preclude alcohol-related liver cirrhosis also."
Gastroenterology, We will need to look for nuclear antibody if it is not done before.
Gastroenterology, PSC is extremely unlikely but possible.
Gastroenterology," Wilson disease also possible diagnosis but again, we first have to figure out if these tests were done for the patient or not."
Gastroenterology, Alpha1-antitrypsin deficiency will be extremely unlikely because the patient has no lung problem.
Gastroenterology, On his end-stage liver disease we already know that he had low platelet count splenomegaly.
Gastroenterology, We know that his bilirubin is elevated and albumin is very low.
Gastroenterology, I suspect that at the time of admission to the hospital the patient presented with encephalopathy.
Gastroenterology, We do not know if INR was checked to look for coagulopathy.
Gastroenterology, The patient had an EGD in 2005 as well as colonoscopy in Silver City.
Gastroenterology, We have to have this result to evaluate if the patient had any varices and if he needs any intervention for that.
Gastroenterology,", At this point in time, I recommended the patient to continue to take lactulose 50 mL 3 times daily."
Gastroenterology, The patient tolerated it well; no diarrhea at this point in time.
Gastroenterology, I also recommended for him to contact his primary care physician for increased dose of opiates for him.
Gastroenterology, As a primary prophylaxis of GI bleeding in patient with end-stage liver disease we will try to use Inderal.
Gastroenterology, The patient got a prescription for 10 mg pills.
Gastroenterology, He will take 10 mg twice daily and we will gradually increase his dose until his heart rate will drop to 25% from 75% to probably 60-58.
Gastroenterology, The patient was educated how to use Inderal and he was explained why we decided to use this medication.
Gastroenterology," The patient will hold this medication if he is orthostatic or bradycardic.,"
Gastroenterology,"Again, the patient and his wife were advised to contact all offices they have seen before to get information about what tests were already done and if on the next visit in 2 weeks we still do not have any information we will need to repeat all these tests I mentioned above."
Gastroenterology,", We also discussed nutrition issues."
Gastroenterology, The patient was provided information that his protein intake is supposed to be about 25 g per day.
Gastroenterology, He was advised not to over-eat protein and advised not to starve.
Gastroenterology, He also was advised to stay away from alcohol.
Gastroenterology, His next visit is in 2 weeks with all results available.

Gastroenterology," Similarly, I am hoping that with proper counseling, the patient will consent to further examination with colonoscopy given his guaiac-positive status, elevated CEA and risk factors., 4."
Gastroenterology," Anemia, normochromic normocytic with low total iron binding capacity."
Gastroenterology, This appears to be anemia of chronic disease.
Gastroenterology," However, this is likely some iron deficiency superimposed on top of this given his recent bleeding, with consider iron, vitamin C, folate and B12 supplementation and discharge given his history of alcoholic malnutrition and recent gastrointestinal bleeding."
Gastroenterology," Total critical care time spent today discussing the case with Dr. X, examining the patient, reviewing laboratory trends, adjusting medications and counseling the patient in excess is 35 minutes."

Gastroenterology,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: , Cholelithiasis, cholecystitis, and recurrent biliary colic., POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: , Severe cholecystitis, cholelithiasis, choledocholithiasis, and morbid obesity., PROCEDURES PERFORMED: , Laparoscopy, laparotomy, cholecystectomy with operative cholangiogram, choledocholithotomy with operative choledochoscopy and T-tube drainage of the common bile duct., ANESTHESIA: , General., INDICATIONS: , This is a 63-year-old white male patient with multiple medical problems including hypertension, diabetes, end-stage renal disease, coronary artery disease, and the patient is on hemodialysis, who has had recurrent episodes of epigastric right upper quadrant pain."
Gastroenterology, The patient was found to have cholelithiasis on last admission.
Gastroenterology, He was being worked up for this including cardiac clearance.
Gastroenterology," However, in the interim, he returned again with another episode of same pain."
Gastroenterology," The patient had a HIDA scan done yesterday, which shows nonvisualization of the gallbladder consistent with cystic duct obstruction."
Gastroenterology," Because of these, laparoscopic cholecystectomy was advised with cholangiogram."
Gastroenterology, Possibility of open laparotomy and open procedure was also explained to the patient.
Gastroenterology," The procedure, indications, risks, and alternatives were discussed with the patient in detail and informed consent was obtained., DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: , The patient was put in supine position on the operating table under satisfactory general anesthesia."
Gastroenterology, The entire abdomen was prepped and draped.
Gastroenterology, A small transverse incision was made about 2-1/2 inches above the umbilicus in the midline under local anesthesia.
Gastroenterology, The patient has a rather long torso.
Gastroenterology, Fascia was opened vertically and stay sutures were placed in the fascia.
Gastroenterology, Peritoneal cavity was carefully entered.
Gastroenterology, Hasson cannula was inserted into the peritoneal cavity and it was insufflated with CO2.
Gastroenterology, Laparoscopic camera was inserted and examination at this time showed difficult visualization with a part of omentum and hepatic flexure of the colon stuck in the subhepatic area.
Gastroenterology, The patient was placed in reverse Trendelenburg and rotated to the left.
Gastroenterology, An 11-mm trocar was placed in the subxiphoid space and two 5-mm in the right subcostal region.
Gastroenterology," Slowly, the dissection was carried out in the right subhepatic area."
Gastroenterology," Initially, I was able to dissect some of the omentum and hepatic flexure off the undersurface of the liver."
Gastroenterology," Then, some inflammatory changes were noted with some fatty necrosis type of changes and it was not quite clear whether this was part of the gallbladder or it was just pericholecystic infection/inflammation."
Gastroenterology," The visualization was extremely difficult because of the patient's obesity and a lot of fat intra-abdominally, although his abdominal wall is not that thick."
Gastroenterology," After evaluating this for a little while, we decided that there was no way that this could be done laparoscopically and proceeded with formal laparotomy."
Gastroenterology," The trocars were removed.,"
Gastroenterology,A right subcostal incision was made and peritoneal cavity was entered.
Gastroenterology, A Bookwalter retractor was put in place.
Gastroenterology, The dissection was then carried out on the undersurface of the liver.
Gastroenterology," Eventually, the gallbladder was identified, which was markedly scarred down and shrunk and appeared to have palpable stone in it."
Gastroenterology," Dissection was further carried down to what was felt to be the common bile duct, which appeared to be somewhat larger than normal about a centimeter in size."
Gastroenterology, The duodenum was kocherized.
Gastroenterology, The gallbladder was partly intrahepatic.
Gastroenterology," Because of this, I decided not to dig it out of the liver bed causing further bleeding and problem."
Gastroenterology," The inferior wall of the gallbladder was opened and two large stones, one was about 3 cm long and another one about 1.5 x 2 cm long, were taken out of the gallbladder."
Gastroenterology,", It was difficult to tell where the cystic duct was."
Gastroenterology," Eventually after probing near the neck of the gallbladder, I did find the cystic duct, which was relatively very short."
Gastroenterology, Intraoperative cystic duct cholangiogram was done using C-arm fluoroscopy.
Gastroenterology, This showed a rounded density at the lower end of the bile duct consistent with the stone.
Gastroenterology," At this time, a decision was made to proceed with common duct exploration."
Gastroenterology, The common duct was opened between stay sutures of 4-0 Vicryl and immediately essentially clear bile came out.
Gastroenterology," After some pressing over the head of the pancreas through a kocherized maneuver, the stone did fall into the opening in the common bile duct."
Gastroenterology," So, it was about a 1-cm size stone, which was removed."

Gastroenterology, The bile ducts were irrigated again.
Gastroenterology, No further stones were removed.
Gastroenterology, A 16-French T-tube was then placed into the bile duct and the bile duct was repaired around the T-tube using 4-0 Vicryl interrupted sutures obtaining watertight closure.
Gastroenterology," A completion T-tube cholangiogram was done at this time, which showed slight narrowing and possibly a filling defect proximally below the confluence of the right and left hepatic duct, although externally, I was unable to see anything or palpate anything in this area."
Gastroenterology," Because of this, the T-tube was removed, and I passed the choledochoscope proximally again, and I was unable to see any evidence of any lesion or any stone in this area."
Gastroenterology," I felt at this time this was most likely an impression from the outside, which was still left over a gallbladder where the stone was stuck and it was impressing on the bile duct."
Gastroenterology, The bile duct lumen was widely open.
Gastroenterology, T-tube was again replaced into the bile duct and closed again and a completion T-tube cholangiogram appeared to be more satisfactory at this time.

Gastroenterology, Infraumbilical incision was performed and taken down to the fascia.
Gastroenterology, The fascia was incised.
Gastroenterology, The peritoneal cavity was carefully entered.
Gastroenterology, Two other ports were placed in the right and left lower quadrants.
Gastroenterology," The appendix was readily identified, and the base of the appendix as well as the mesoappendix was divided with the Endo GIA stapler and brought out through the umbilical wound with the Endocatch bag., All hemostasis was further reconfirmed."
Gastroenterology, No leakage of enteral contents was noted.
Gastroenterology, All trocars were removed under direct visualization.
Gastroenterology, The umbilical fascia was closed with interrupted 0
Gastroenterology,Vicryl sutures.
Gastroenterology, The skin was closed with 4-0 Monocryl subcuticular stitch and dressed with Steri-Strips and 4 x 4's.

Gastroenterology, She was taken to the operating room and given perioperative antibiotics prior to coming to the surgery.
Gastroenterology, General anesthesia was carried out without difficulty and a Foley catheter was inserted.
Gastroenterology, The left arm was tucked and the abdomen was prepped with Betadine and draped in sterile fashion.
Gastroenterology, A 5-mm blunt port was inserted infra-umbilically at the level of the umbilicus under direct vision of a 5-mm 0-degree laparoscope.
Gastroenterology," Once we were inside the abdominal cavity, CO2 was instilled to attain an adequate pneumoperitoneum."
Gastroenterology, A left lower quadrant 5-mm port was placed under direct vision and a 12-mm port in the suprapubic region.
Gastroenterology, The 5-mm scope was introduced at the umbilical port and the appendix was easily visualized.
Gastroenterology, The base of the cecum was acutely inflamed but not perforated.
Gastroenterology, I then was easily able to grasp the mesoappendix and create a window between the base of the mesoappendix and the base of the appendix.
Gastroenterology, The window is big enough to get an Endo GIA blue cartridge through it and fired across the base of the mesoappendix without difficulty.
Gastroenterology," I reloaded with a red vascular cartridge, came across the mesoappendix without difficulty."
Gastroenterology, I then placed the appendix in an Endobag and brought out through the suprapubic port without difficulty.
Gastroenterology, I reinserted the suprapubic port and irrigated out the right lower quadrant until dry.
Gastroenterology, One final inspection revealed no bleeding from the staple line.
Gastroenterology," We then removed all ports under direct vision, and there was no bleeding from the abdominal trocar sites."
Gastroenterology, The pneumoperitoneum was then deflated and the suprapubic fascial defect was closed with 0-Vicryl suture.
Gastroenterology, The skin incision was injected with 0.25% Marcaine and closed with 4-0 Monocryl suture.
Gastroenterology, Steri-strips and sterile dressings were applied.
Gastroenterology, No complications.
Gastroenterology, Minimal blood loss.
Gastroenterology, Specimen is the appendix.
Gastroenterology, Brought to the recovery room in stable condition.
Gastroenterology,"REASON FOR CONSULTATION: , Pneumatosis coli in the cecum., HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  , The patient is an 87-year-old gentleman who was admitted on 10/27/07 with weakness and tiredness with aspiration pneumonia."
Gastroenterology," The patient is very difficult to obtain information from; however, he appears to be having frequent nausea and vomiting with an aspiration pneumonia and abdominal discomfort."
Gastroenterology," In addition, this hospitalization, he has undergone an upper endoscopy, which found a small ulcer after dropping his hematocrit and becoming anemic."
Gastroenterology," He had a CT scan on Friday, 11/02/07, which apparently showed pneumatosis and his cecum worrisome for ischemic colitis as well as bilateral hydronephrosis and multiple liver lesions, which could be metastatic disease versus cysts."
Gastroenterology," In discussions with the patient, he had multiple bowel movements yesterday and is currently passing flatus and has epigastric pain., PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  , Obtained from the medical chart."
Gastroenterology," Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, history of pneumonia, and aspiration pneumonia, osteoporosis, alcoholism, microcytic anemia., MEDICATIONS: , Per his current medical chart., ALLERGIES: , NO KNOWN DRUG ALLERGIES., SOCIAL HISTORY: , The patient had a long history of smoking but quit many years ago."
Gastroenterology," He does have chronic alcohol use., PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:, GENERAL:  A very thin white male who is dyspneic and having difficulty breathing at the moment., VITAL SIGNS:  Afebrile."
Gastroenterology, Heart rate in the 100s to 120s at times with atrial fibrillation.
Gastroenterology, Respiratory rate is 17-20.
Gastroenterology," Blood pressure 130s-150s/60s-70s., NECK:  Soft and supple, full range of motion., HEART:  Regular., ABDOMEN:  Distended with tenderness mainly in the upper abdomen but very difficult to localize due to his difficulty providing information."
Gastroenterology," He does appear to have tenderness but does not have rebound and does not have peritoneal signs., DIAGNOSTICS: , A CT scan done on 11/02/07 shows pneumatosis in the cecum with an enlarged cecum filled with stool and air fluid levels with chronically dilated small bowel.,"
Gastroenterology,"ASSESSMENT: , Possible ischemic cecum with possible metastatic disease, bilateral hydronephrosis on atrial fibrillation, aspiration pneumonia, chronic alcohol abuse, acute renal failure, COPD, anemia with gastric ulcer., PLAN: , The patient appears to have pneumatosis from a CT scan 2 days ago."
Gastroenterology," Nothing was done about it at that time as the patient appeared to not be symptomatic, but he continues to have nausea and vomiting with abdominal pain, but the fact that pneumatosis was found 2 days ago and the patient has survived this long indicates this may be a benign process at the moment, and I would recommend getting a repeat CT scan to assess it further to see if there is worsening of pneumatosis versus resolution to further evaluate the liver lesions and make decisions regarding planning at that time."
Gastroenterology," The patient has frequent desaturations secondary to his aspiration pneumonia, and any surgical procedure or any surgical intervention would certainly require intubation, which would then necessitate long-term ventilator care as he is not someone who would be able to come off of a ventilator very well in his current state."
Gastroenterology, So we will look at the CT scan and make decisions based on the findings as far as that is concerned.

Gastroenterology, Examination at this time showed fair amount of chronic granulation tissue and scarred tissue circumferentially as well as the base of this decubitus ulcer.
Gastroenterology, This was sharply excised until bleeding and healthy tissue was obtained circumferentially as well as the base.
Gastroenterology," The ulcer does not appear to be going into the bone itself as there was a covering on the bone, which appears to be quite healthy, normal and bone itself appeared solid."
Gastroenterology,", I did not rongeur the bone."
Gastroenterology, The deeper portion of the excised tissue was also sent for tissue cultures.
Gastroenterology, Hemostasis was achieved with cautery and the wound was irrigated with sterile saline solution and then packed with medicated Kerlix.

Gastroenterology,"REASON FOR VISIT: , Followup of laparoscopic fundoplication and gastrostomy., HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , The patient is a delightful baby girl, who is now nearly 8 months of age and had a tracheostomy for subglottic stenosis."
Gastroenterology, Laparoscopic fundoplication and gastrostomy was done because of the need for enteral feeding access and to protect her airway at a time when it is either going to heal enough to improve and allow decannulation or eventually prove that she will need laryngotracheoplasty.
Gastroenterology, Dr. X is following The patient for this and currently plans are to perform a repeat endoscopic exam every couple of months to assist the status of her airway caliber.

Gastroenterology," There is not even a hint of granulation tissue or erythema, and I am very happy with the overall appearance."
Gastroenterology,", IMPRESSION: , The patient is doing exceptionally well status post laparoscope fundoplication and gastrostomy."
Gastroenterology," Hopefully, the exquisite control of acid reflux by fundoplication will help her airway heal, and if she does well, allow decannulation in the future."
Gastroenterology," If she does require laryngotracheoplasty, the protection from acid reflux will be important to healing of that procedure as well., PLAN:  , The patient will follow up as needed for problems related to gastrostomy."
Gastroenterology, We will see her when she comes in the hospital for endoscopic exams and possibly laryngotracheoplasty in the future.

Gastroenterology," Upon seeing the patient and discussing in extent with the family, it was decided the patient needed to go to the operating room for this nonreducible umbilical hernia and bowel obstruction and the family agreed with surgery., INTRAOPERATIVE FINDINGS: , The patient was found to have an incarcerated umbilical hernia."
Gastroenterology, There was a loop of small bowel incarcerated within the hernia sac.
Gastroenterology," It showed signs of ecchymosis, however no signs of any ischemia or necrosis."
Gastroenterology," It was easily reduced once opening the abdomen and the rest of the small bowel was ran without any other defects or abnormalities., PROCEDURE: ,"
Gastroenterology,"After informed written consent, risks and benefits of the procedure were explained to the patient and the patient's family."
Gastroenterology, The patient was brought to the operating suite.
Gastroenterology," After general endotracheal intubation, prepped and draped in normal sterile fashion."
Gastroenterology, A midline incision was made around the umbilical hernia defect with a #10 blade scalpel.
Gastroenterology, Dissection was then carried down to the fascia.
Gastroenterology," Using a sharp dissection, an incision was made above the defect superior to the defect entering the fascia."
Gastroenterology, The abdomen was entered under direct visualization.
Gastroenterology," The small bowel that was entrapped within the hernia sac was easily reduced and observed and appeared to be ecchymotic, however, no signs of ischemia were noted or necrosis."
Gastroenterology, The remaining of the fascia was then extended using Metzenbaum scissors.
Gastroenterology, The hernia sac was removed using Mayo scissors and sent off as specimen.
Gastroenterology," Next, the bowel was run from the ligament of Treitz to the ileocecal valve with no evidence of any other abnormalities."
Gastroenterology, The small bowel was then milked down removing all the fluid.
Gastroenterology, The bowel was decompressed distal to the obstruction.
Gastroenterology," Once returning the abdominal contents to the abdomen, attention was next made in closing the abdomen and using #1 Vicryl suture in the figure-of-eight fashion the fascia was closed."
Gastroenterology, The umbilicus was then reapproximated to its anatomical position with a #1 Vicryl suture.
Gastroenterology, A #3-0 Vicryl suture was then used to reapproximate the deep dermal layers and skin staples were used on the skin.
Gastroenterology, Sterile dressings were applied.
Gastroenterology, The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to recovery in stable condition.
Gastroenterology,"MEDICATIONS:,  None., DESCRIPTION OF THE PROCEDURE:,  After informed consent was obtained, the patient was placed in the left lateral decubitus position and the Olympus video colonoscope was inserted through the anus and advanced in retrograde fashion for a distance of *** cm to the proximal descending colon and then slowly withdrawn."

Gastroenterology," The patient had retrograde cystogram, which revealed colovesical fistula."
Gastroenterology, Recommendation for a surgery was made.
Gastroenterology, The patient was explained the risks and benefits as well as the two sons and the daughter.
Gastroenterology, They understood that the patient can even die from this procedure.
Gastroenterology," All the three procedures were explained, without a colostomy, with Hartmann's colostomy, and with a transverse loop colostomy, and out of the three procedures, the patient's requested to have the loop colostomy and stated that the Hartmann's colostomy leaving the anastomosis with the risk of leaking., PROCEDURE DETAILS: , The patient was taken to the operating room, prepped and draped in the sterile fashion and was given general anesthetic."
Gastroenterology, An incision was performed in the midline below the umbilicus to the pubis with a #10 blade Bard Parker.
Gastroenterology, Electrocautery was used for hemostasis down to the fascia.
Gastroenterology," The fascia was grasped with Ochsner's and then immediately the peritoneum was entered and the incision was carried cephalad and caudad with electrocautery.,"
Gastroenterology,"Once within the peritoneum, adhesiolysis was performed to separate the small bowel from the attachment of the anterior abdominal wall."
Gastroenterology," At this point, immediately a small bowel was retracted cephalad."
Gastroenterology, The patient was taken to a slightly Trendelenburg position and the descending colon was seen.
Gastroenterology, The white line of Toldt was opened all the way down to the area of inflammation.
Gastroenterology," At this point, meticulous dissection was carried to separate the small bowel from the attachment to the abscess."
Gastroenterology," When the small bowel was completely freed of  abscess, bulk of the bladder was seen anteriorly to the uterus."
Gastroenterology, The abscess was cultured and sent it back to Bacteriology Department and immediately the opening into the bladder was visualized.
Gastroenterology," At this point, the entire sigmoid colon was separated posteriorly as well as laterally and it was all the way down to sigmoid down to the rectum."
Gastroenterology," At this point, decision to place a moist towel and retract old intestine superiorly as well as to place first self-retaining retractor in the abdominal cavity with a bladder blade was placed."
Gastroenterology," Immediately, a GIA was fired right across the descending colon and sigmoid colon junction and then with peons within the mesentery were placed all the way down to the rectosigmoid junction where a TA-55 balloon Roticulator was fired."
Gastroenterology, The specimen was cut with #10 blade Bard-Parker and sent it to Pathology.
Gastroenterology, Immediately copious amount of irrigation was used and the staple line in the descending colon was brought with Allis.
Gastroenterology, A pursestring device was fired.
Gastroenterology, The staple line was cut.
Gastroenterology," The dilators were used using #25 and #29, then _________ #29 EEA was placed and the suture was tied."
Gastroenterology," At this point, attention was directed down to the rectal stump where dilators #25 and #29 were passed from the anus into the rectum and then the #29 Ethicon GIA was introduced."
Gastroenterology, The spike came posteriorly through the staple line to avoid the inflammatory process anteriorly that was present in the area of the cul-de-sac as well as the uterine was present in this patient.
Gastroenterology," , Immediately, the EEA was connected with a mushroom."
Gastroenterology," It was tied, fired, and a Doyen was placed above the anastomosis approximately four inches."
Gastroenterology, Fluid was placed within the _________ and immediately a colonoscope was introduced from the patient's anus insufflating air.
Gastroenterology, No air was seen evolving from the staple line.
Gastroenterology, All fluid was removed and pictures of the staple line were taken.
Gastroenterology, The scope was removed at this point.
Gastroenterology, The case was passed to Dr. X for repair of the vesicle fistula.
Gastroenterology, Dr. X did repair down the perforation of the bladder that was communicating with an abscess secondary to the perforated diverticulitis and the colon.
Gastroenterology," After this was performed, copious amount of irrigation was used again."
Gastroenterology, More lysis of adhesions were performed and decision to make a loop transverse colostomy was made to protect the anastomosis in a phase of a severe inflammatory process in the pelvis in the infected area.
Gastroenterology, The incision was performed in the right upper quadrant.
Gastroenterology,", This incision was performed with cutting in the cautery, down into the fascia splitting the muscle and then the Penrose was passed under transverse colon, and was grasped on pulling the transverse colon at the level of the skin."
Gastroenterology, The wire was passed under the transverse colon.
Gastroenterology, It was left in place.
Gastroenterology," Moderate irrigation was used in the peritoneal cavity and in the right lower quadrant, a JP was placed in the pelvis posteriorly to the abscess cavity that was down on the pelvis."
Gastroenterology," At this point, immediately, yellow fluid was removed from the peritoneal cavity and the abdomen was closed with cephalad to caudad and caudad to cephalad with a loop PDS suture and then tied."
Gastroenterology, Electrocautery for hemostasis and the subcutaneous tissue.
Gastroenterology, Copious amount of irrigation was used.
Gastroenterology, The skin was approximated with staples.
Gastroenterology," At this point, immediately, the wound was covered with a moist towel and decision to mature the loop colostomy was made."
Gastroenterology, The colostomy was opened longitudinally and then matured with interrupted #3-0 Vicryl suture through the skin edge.
Gastroenterology," One it was completely matured, immediately the index finger was probed proximally and distally and both loops were completely opened."

Gastroenterology,", PROCEDURE:  , After adequate general anesthesia was administered, the patient's abdomen was prepped and draped aseptically."
Gastroenterology,Sutures and staples were removed.
Gastroenterology,The abdomen was opened.
Gastroenterology,The were some very early stage adhesions that were easy to separate.
Gastroenterology,Dissection was carried up toward the upper abdomen where the patient was found to have a stool filled descended colon.
Gastroenterology,This was retracted caudally to expose the stomach.
Gastroenterology,There were a number of adhesions to the stomach.
Gastroenterology,These were carefully dissected to expose initially the closure over the gastrotomy site.
Gastroenterology,Initially this looked like this was leaking
Gastroenterology,but it was actually found to be intact.
Gastroenterology, The pyloroplasty was identified and also found to be intact with no evidence of leakage.
Gastroenterology,Further dissection up toward the hiatus revealed an abscess collection.
Gastroenterology,This was sent for culture and sensitivity and was aspirated and lavaged.
Gastroenterology,Cavity tracked up toward the hiatus.
Gastroenterology,"Stomach itself appeared viable, there was no necrotic sections."
Gastroenterology,Upper apex of the stomach was felt to be viable also.
Gastroenterology,"I did not pull the stomach and esophagus down into the abdomen from the mediastinum, but placed a sucker up into the mediastinum where additional turbid fluid was identified."
Gastroenterology,Carefully placed a 10 mm flat Jackson-Pratt drain into the mediastinum through the hiatus to control this area of leakage.
Gastroenterology,Two additional Jackson-Pratt drains were placed essentially through the gastrohepatic omentum.
Gastroenterology,This was the area that most of the drainage had collected in.
Gastroenterology,As I had previously discussed with Dr. Sageman I did not feel that mobilizing the stomach to redo the anastomosis in the chest would be a recoverable situation for the patient.
Gastroenterology,I therefore did not push to visualize any focal areas of the anastomosis with the intent of repair.
Gastroenterology,"Once the drains were secured, they were brought out through the anterior abdominal wall and secured with 3-0 silk sutures and secured to bulb suction."
Gastroenterology,The midline fascia was then closed using running #2 Prolene sutures bolstered with retention sutures.
Gastroenterology,Subcutaneous tissue was copiously lavaged and then the skin was closed with loosely approximated staples.

Gastroenterology, She has had an __________ cough and relatively disinterested in oral intake for the past month.
Gastroenterology, She was recently in the GI Clinic and an x-ray was ordered to check her tube placement and an incidental finding of a coin in the proximal esophagus was noted.
Gastroenterology," Based on the history, it is quite possible this coin has been there close to a month."
Gastroenterology, She is brought to the operating room now for attempted removal.
Gastroenterology, I met with the parents and talked to them at length about the procedure and the increased risk in a child with a coin that has been in for a prolonged period of time.
Gastroenterology," Hopefully, there will be no coin migration or significant irrigation that would require prolonged hospitalization."
Gastroenterology,", OPERATIVE FINDINGS: , The patient had a penny lodged in the proximal esophagus in the typical location."
Gastroenterology," There was no evidence of external migration and surrounding irritation was noted, but did not appear to be excessive."
Gastroenterology," The coin actually came out with relative ease after which endoscopically identified., DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION: , The patient came to the operating room and had induction of general anesthesia."
Gastroenterology, She was slow to respond to the usual propofol and other inducing agents and may be has some difficulty with tolerance or __________ tolerance to these medications.
Gastroenterology," After her endotracheal tube was placed and securely taped to the left side of her mouth, I positioned the patient with a prominent shoulder roll and neck hyperextension and then used the laryngoscope to elevate the tiny glottic mechanism."
Gastroenterology," A rigid esophagoscope was then inserted into the proximal esophagus, and the scope was gradually advanced with the lumen directly in frontal view."
Gastroenterology," This was facilitated by the nasoenteric feeding tube that was in place, which I followed carefully until the edge of the coin could be seen."
Gastroenterology," At this location, there was quite a bit of surrounding mucosal inflammation, but the coin edge could be clearly seen and was secured with the coin grasping forceps."
Gastroenterology," I then withdrew the scope, forceps, and the coin as one unit, and it was easily retrieved."
Gastroenterology, The patient tolerated the procedure well.

Gastroenterology, We enlarged the diaphragmatic hiatus so as to be able to place approximately 3 fingers into the chest.
Gastroenterology, We also did a portion of the esophageal dissection from the abdomen into the chest area.
Gastroenterology, The esophagus and the esophageal hiatus were identified in the abdomen.
Gastroenterology, We next turned our attention to the left gastric artery.
Gastroenterology, The left gastric artery was identified at the base of the stomach.
Gastroenterology, We first took the left gastric vein by ligating and dividing it using 0 silk ties.
Gastroenterology, The left gastric artery was next taken using suture ligature with silk ties followed by 2-0 stick tie reinforcement.
Gastroenterology, At this point the stomach was freely mobile.
Gastroenterology, We then turned our attention to performing our jejunostomy feeding tube.
Gastroenterology, A 2-0 Vicryl pursestring was placed in the jejunum approximately 20 cm distal to the ligament of Treitz.
Gastroenterology, We then used Bovie electrocautery to open the jejunum at this site.
Gastroenterology, We placed a 16-French red rubber catheter through this site.
Gastroenterology, We tied down in place.
Gastroenterology, We then used 3-0 silk sutures to perform a Witzel.
Gastroenterology," Next, the loop of jejunum was tacked up to the abdominal wall using 2-0 silk ties."

Gastroenterology," Next, we incised the peritoneum over the esophagus."
Gastroenterology, We dissected the esophagus to just above the azygos vein.
Gastroenterology," The azygos vein, in fact, was taken with 0 silk ligatures and reinforced with 2-0 stick ties."
Gastroenterology," As mentioned, we dissected the esophagus both proximally and distally down to the level of the hiatus."
Gastroenterology," After doing this, we backed our NG tube out to above the level where we planned to perform our pursestring."
Gastroenterology, We used an automatic pursestring and applied.
Gastroenterology, We then transected the proximal portion of the stomach with Metzenbaum scissors.
Gastroenterology, We secured our pursestring and then placed a 28 anvil in the divided proximal portion of the esophagus.
Gastroenterology, The pursestring was then tied down without difficulty.
Gastroenterology," Next, we tabularized our stomach using a #80 GIA stapler."
Gastroenterology," After doing so, we chose a portion of the stomach more distally and opened it using Bovie electrocautery."
Gastroenterology, We placed our EEA stapler through it and then punched out through the gastric wall.
Gastroenterology, We connected our anvil to the EEA stapler.
Gastroenterology, This was then secured appropriately.
Gastroenterology, We checked to make sure that there was appropriate muscle apposition.
Gastroenterology, We then fired the stapler.
Gastroenterology," We obtained 2 complete rings, 1 of the esophagus and 1 of the stomach, which were sent for pathology."
Gastroenterology, We also sent the gastroesophageal specimen for pathology.
Gastroenterology, Of note was the fact that the frozen section showed no evidence of tumor and in the proximal distal margins.
Gastroenterology, We then turned our attention to closing the gastrostomy opening.
Gastroenterology, This was closed with 2-0 Vicryl in a running fashion.
Gastroenterology, We then buttressed this with serosal 3-0 Vicryl interrupted sutures.
Gastroenterology, We returned the newly constructed gastroesophageal anastomosis into the chest and covered it by covering the pleura over it.
Gastroenterology," Next, we placed two #28-French chest tubes, 1 anteriorly and 1 posteriorly, taking care not to place it near the anastomosis."
Gastroenterology, We then closed the chest with #2 Vicryl in an interrupted figure-of-eight fashion.
Gastroenterology, The lung was brought up.
Gastroenterology, We closed the muscle layers with #0 Vicryl followed by #0 Vicryl; then we closed the subcutaneous layer with 2-0 Vicryl and the skin with 4-0 Monocryl.

Gastroenterology, She provided her consent.
Gastroenterology," The morning of the operation, the patient was transported from the preoperative holding area to the endoscopy suite."
Gastroenterology, She was placed in the left lateral decubitus position.
Gastroenterology," In divided doses, she was given 7 mg of Versed and 125 mcg of fentanyl."
Gastroenterology," A digital rectal examination was performed, after which time the scope was intubated from the anus to the level of the hepatic flexure."
Gastroenterology," This was intubated fairly easily; however, the patient was clearly in some discomfort and was shouting out, despite the amount of anesthesia she was provided."
Gastroenterology," In truth, the pain she was experiencing was out of proportion to any maneuver or difficulty with the procedure."
Gastroenterology," While more medication could have been given, the patient is actually a fairly thin woman and diminutive and I was concerned that giving her any more sedation may lead to respiratory or cardiovascular collapse."
Gastroenterology," In addition, she was really having quite some difficulty staying still throughout the procedure and was putting us all at some risk."
Gastroenterology," For this reason, the procedure was aborted at the level of the hepatic flexure."
Gastroenterology, She was noted to have some pools of stool.
Gastroenterology," This was suctioned and sent to pathology for C difficile, ova and parasites, and fecal leukocytes."
Gastroenterology," Additionally, random biopsies were performed of the colon itself."
Gastroenterology," It is unfortunate we were unable to complete this procedure, as I would have liked to have taken biopsies of the terminal ileum."
Gastroenterology," However, given the degree of discomfort she had, again, coupled with the relative ease of the procedure itself, I am very suspicious of irritable bowel syndrome."
Gastroenterology," The patient tolerated the remainder of the procedure fairly well and was sent to the recovery room in stable condition, where it is anticipated she will be discharged to home., PLAN:,  She needs to follow up with me in approximately 2 weeks' time, both to follow up with her biopsies and cultures."
Gastroenterology," She has been given a prescription for VSL3, a probiotic, to assist with reculturing the rectum."
Gastroenterology, She may also benefit from an antispasmodic and/or anxiolytic.

Gastroenterology, Came in approximately 36 hours ago with pain across his lower abdomen.
Gastroenterology, CT scan demonstrated presence of an abscess beneath the incision.
Gastroenterology, I recommended to the patient he undergo the above-named procedure.
Gastroenterology," Procedure, purpose, risks, expected benefits, potential complications, alternatives forms of therapy were discussed with him, and he was agreeable to surgery., FINDINGS:,  The patient was found to have an abscess that went down to the level of the fascia."
Gastroenterology, The anterior layer of the fascia was fibrinous and some portions necrotic.
Gastroenterology," This was excisionally debrided using the Bovie cautery, and there were multiple pieces of suture within the wound and these were removed as well., TECHNIQUE:  , Patient was identified, then taken into the operating room, where after induction of appropriate anesthesia, his abdomen was prepped with Betadine solution and draped in a sterile fashion."
Gastroenterology, The wound opening where it was draining was explored using a curette.
Gastroenterology," The extent of the wound marked with a marking pen and using the Bovie cautery, the abscess was opened and drained."
Gastroenterology, I then noted that there was a significant amount of undermining.
Gastroenterology," These margins were marked with a marking pen, excised with Bovie cautery; the curette was used to remove the necrotic fascia."
Gastroenterology," The wound was irrigated; cultures sent prior to irrigation and after achievement of excellent hemostasis, the wound was packed with antibiotic-soaked gauze."
Gastroenterology, A dressing was applied.
Gastroenterology, The finished wound size was 9.0 x 5.3 x 5.2 cm in size.
Gastroenterology, Patient tolerated the procedure well.
Gastroenterology," Dressing was applied, and he was taken to recovery room in stable condition."
Gastroenterology,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:  , 1."
Gastroenterology," Congenital chylous ascites and chylothorax., 2."
Gastroenterology," Rule out infradiaphragmatic lymphatic leak., POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: , Diffuse intestinal and mesenteric lymphangiectasia."
Gastroenterology,", ANESTHESIA: , General., INDICATION:  , The patient is an unfortunate 6-month-old baby boy, who has been hospitalized most of his life with recurrent chylothoraces and chylous ascites."
Gastroenterology," The patient has been treated somewhat successfully with TPN and voluntary restriction of enteral nutrition, but he had repeated chylothoraces."
Gastroenterology," Last week, Dr. X took the patient to the operating room in hopes that with thoracotomy, a thoracic duct leak could be found, which would be successfully closed surgically."
Gastroenterology, However at the time of his thoracotomy exploration what was discovered was a large amount of transdiaphragmatic transition of chylous ascites coming from the abdomen.
Gastroenterology, Dr. X opened the diaphragm and could literally see a fountain of chylous fluid exiting through the diaphragmatic hole.
Gastroenterology," This was closed, and we decided that perhaps an abdominal exploration as a last stage effort would allow us to find an area of lymphatic leak that could potentially help the patient from this dismal prognostic disease."
Gastroenterology," We met with his parents and talked to them about this, and he is here today for that attempt., OPERATIVE FINDINGS:  , The patient's abdomen was relatively soft, minimally distended."
Gastroenterology, Exploration through supraumbilical transverse incision immediately revealed a large amount of chylous ascites upon entering into the peritoneal cavity.
Gastroenterology," What we found which explains the chronic chylous ascites and chylothorax was a diffuse lymphangiectatic picture involving the small bowel mesentery approximately two thirds to three quarters of the distal small bowel including all of the ileum, the cecum, and the portion of the ascending colon."
Gastroenterology, It appeared that any attempt to resect this area would have been met with failure because of the extensive lymphatic dilatation all the way down towards the root of the supramesenteric artery.
Gastroenterology," There was about one quarter to one third of the jejunum that did not appear to be grossly involved, but I did not think that resection of three quarters of the patient's small bowel would be viable surgical option."
Gastroenterology," Instead, we opted to close his abdomen and refer for potential small intestine transplantation procedure in the future if he is a candidate for that."
Gastroenterology,", The lymphatic abnormality was extensive."
Gastroenterology, They were linear dilated lymphatic channels on the serosal surface of the bowel in the mesentery.
Gastroenterology, They were small aneurysm-like pockets of chyle all along the course of the mesenteric structures and in the mesentery medially adjacent to the bowel as well.
Gastroenterology, No other major retroperitoneal structure or correctable structure was identified.
Gastroenterology," Both indirect inguinal hernias were wide open and could be palpated from an internal aspect as well., DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION:  , The patient was brought from the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit to the operating room within an endotracheal tube im place and with enteral feeds established at full flow to provide maximum fat content and maximum lymphatic flow."
Gastroenterology, We conducted a surgical time-out and reiterated all of the patient's important identifying information and confirmed the operative plan as described above.
Gastroenterology, Preparation and draping of his abdomen was done with chlorhexidine based prep solution and then we opened his peritoneal cavity through a transverse supraumbilical incision dividing both rectus muscles and all layers of the abdominal wall fascia.
Gastroenterology," As the peritoneal cavity was entered, we divided the umbilical vein ligamentum teres remnant between Vicryl ties, and we were able to readily identify a large amount of chylous ascites that had been previously described."
Gastroenterology," The bowel was eviscerated, and then with careful inspection, we were able to identify this extensive area of intestinal and mesenteric lymphangiectasia that was a source of the patient's chylous ascites."
Gastroenterology," The small bowel from the ligament of Treitz to the proximal to mid jejunum was largely unaffected, but did not appear that resection of 75% of the small intestine and colon would be a satisfactory tradeoff for The patient, but would likely render him with significant short bowel and nutritional and metabolic problems."
Gastroenterology," Furthermore, it might burn bridges necessary for consideration of intestinal transplantation in the future if that becomes an option."
Gastroenterology," We suctioned free all of the chylous accumulations, replaced the intestines to their peritoneal cavity, and then closed the patient's abdominal incision with 4-0 PDS on the posterior sheath and 3-0 PDS on the anterior rectus sheath."
Gastroenterology, Subcuticular 5-0 Monocryl and Steri-Strips were used for skin closure.
Gastroenterology,", The patient tolerated the procedure well."
Gastroenterology," He lost minimal blood, but did lose approximately 100 mL of chylous fluid from the abdomen that was suctioned free as part of the chylous ascitic leak."
Gastroenterology," The patient was returned to the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit with his endotracheal tube in place and to consider the next stage of management, which might be an attempted additional type of feeding or referral to an Intestinal Transplantation Center to see if that is an option for the patient because he has no universally satisfactory medical or surgical treatment for this at this time."

Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, He states there has been some tenderness associated with the tracheostomy tube and difficulty with swallowing and he wishes to have it removed.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, Apparently there is no history of any airway issues while sleeping or need for uncapping the tube and essentially the tube has just remained present for months capped in his neck.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," No history of any previous tracheostomy tube insertion., PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: , COPD, history of hypercarbic hypoxemia, history of coronary artery disease, history of previous myocardial infarction, and history of liver cirrhosis secondary to alcohol use., PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  , Tonsillectomy, adenoidectomy, cholecystectomy, appendectomy, hernia repair, and tracheostomy., FAMILY HISTORY:  , Strong for heart disease, coronary artery disease, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and cerebrovascular accident., CURRENT MEDICATIONS:,  Prevacid, folic acid, aspirin, morphine sulfate, Pulmicort, Risperdal, Colace, clonazepam, Lotrisone, Roxanol, Ambien, Zolpidem tartrate, simethicone, Robitussin, and prednisone., ALLERGIES: , Nitroglycerin., SOCIAL HISTORY: , The patient has a 25-year-smoking history, which I believe is quite heavy and he has a significant alcohol use in the past., PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  , VITAL SIGNS:  Age 64, blood pressure is 110/78, pulse 96, and temperature is 98.6., GENERAL:  The patient was examined in his wheelchair, resting comfortably, in no acute distress., HEAD:  Normocephalic."

Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," His vocal cords moved well, and I do not see any signs of granuloma or airway obstruction either in the supraglottic or subglottic region, and I felt he would tolerate the tube being removed with close monitoring by nursing at his extended care facility."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," I did impress the fact that I believe he probably will have other events requiring airway support, which could include intubation, and if the intubation is prolonged a tracheostomy may be needed."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," Creation of a long-term tracheostoma may be beneficial whereas the patient would not need such a long tracheostomy tube, and I informed the patient there are other options other than the tube he has at the present time."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," The patient still wished to have the tube removed and he is aware he may need to have it replaced or he may have trouble with the area healing or scarring or he could end up having an emergent airway situation with the tube gone, but wishes to have it removed, and I did remove it today."

Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," Next, an antegrade cardioplegia needle and associated sump were placed in the ascending aorta."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, We then prepared to cross-clamp the aorta.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, We went down on our flows and cross-clamped the aorta.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, We backed up our flows.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, We then gave antegrade and retrograde cold blood cardioplegia solution circuit so as to arrest the heart.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," The patient had some aortic insufficiency so we elected, after initially arresting the heart, to open the aorta and transect it and then give direct ostial infusion of cardioplegia solution circuit."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," Next, after obtaining complete diastolic arrest of the heart, we turned our attention to exposing the aortic valve, and 4-0 Tycron sutures were placed in the commissures."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," In addition, a 2-0 Prolene suture was placed in the aortic wall so as to bring the aortic wall and root up into view."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," Next, scissors were used to excise the diseased aortic valve leaflets."

Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," Next, we placed our proximal suture line of interrupted 4-0 Tycron sutures for the annulus."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, We started with our individual commissural stitches.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, They were connected to our valve sewing ring.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," Next, we placed 5 interrupted 4-0 Tycron sutures in a subannular fashion at each commissural position."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," After doing so, we passed 1 end of the suture through the sewing portion of the Toronto stentless porcine valve."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, The valve was lowered into place and all of the sutures were tied.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," Next, we gave another round of cold blood antegrade and retrograde cardioplegia."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," Next, we sewed our distal suture line."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, We began with the left coronary cusp of the valve.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, We ran a 5-0 RB needle up both sides of the valve.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, Care was taken to avoid the left coronary ostia.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, This procedure was repeated on the right cusp of the stentless porcine valve.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," Again, care was taken to avoid any injury to the coronary ostia."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," Lastly, we sewed our non-coronary cusp."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, This was done without difficulty.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, At this point we inspected our aortic valve.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," There was good coaptation of the leaflets, and it was noted that both the left and the right coronary ostia were open."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, We gave another round of cold blood antegrade and retrograde cardioplegia.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, The antegrade portion was given in a direct ostial fashion once again.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, We now turned our attention to closing the aorta.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, A 4-0 Prolene double row of suture was used to close the aorta in a running fashion.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," Just prior to closing, we de-aired the heart and gave a warm shot of antegrade and retrograde cardioplegia."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," At this point, we removed our aortic cross-clamp."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, The heart gradually regained its electromechanical activity.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, We placed 2 atrial and 2 ventricular pacing wires.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, We removed our aortic vent and oversewed that site with another 4-0 Prolene on an SH needle.

Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, We then gave full-dose protamine.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," After knowing that there was no evidence of a protamine reaction, we removed the aortic cannula."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, We buttressed that site with a 4-0 Prolene on an SH needle.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, We placed a mediastinal chest tube and brought it out through the skin.

Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," Next, a thrombectomy was done using a #4 Fogarty catheter."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, Some of the clot and thrombus was removed from the venous limb.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, The balloon did hang up in the multiple places along the venous limb signifying some degree of stenosis.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," Once removing most of the clots from the venous limb prior to removing the plug, dilators were passed down the venous limb also indicating the area of stenosis."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," At this point, we felt the patient would benefit from a curettage of the venous limb of the graft."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, This was done and subsequent passes with the dilator and the balloon were then very easy and smooth following the curettage.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, The Fogarty balloon was then passed beyond the clot and the plug.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, The plug was visualized and inspected.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, This also gave a good brisk bleeding from the graft.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, The patient was heparinized and hep saline solution was injected into the venous limb and the angle vascular clamp was applied to the venous limb.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, Attention was directed up to its anastomosis and the vein.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, Fogarty balloon and thrombectomy was also performed well enough into this way.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, There was good venous back bleeding following this.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, The area was checked for any stenosis with the dilators and none was present.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," Next, a #6-0 Prolene suture was used in a running fashion to close the graft."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," Just prior to tying the suture, the graft was allowed to flush to move any debris or air."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," The suture was also checked at that point for augmentation, which was good."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, The suture was tied down and the wound was irrigated with antibiotic solution.

Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, The patient was prepped and draped in the usual fashion.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, A posterolateral thoracotomy was performed.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, It included the previous incision.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, The chest was entered through the fifth intercostal space.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," Actually, there was a very strong and hard parietal pleura, which initially did not allow us to obtain a good exposure, and actually the layer was so tough that the pin of the chest retractor broke."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," Thanks to Dr. X's ingenuity, we were able to reuse the chest retractor and opened the chest after I incised the thickened parietal pleura resulting in an explosion of gas and pus from a cavity that was obviously welled off by the parietal pleura."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, We aspirated an abundant amount of pus from this cavity.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," The sample was taken for culture and sensitivity.,"
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary,"Then, at least half an hour was spent trying to excise the parietal pleura and finally we were able to accomplish that up to the apex and back to the aorta __________ towards the heart including his diaphragm."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," Once we accomplished that, we proceeded to remove the solid exudate that was adhered to the lung."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, Further samples for culture and sensitivity were sent.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary,", Then, we were left with the trapped lung."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, It was trapped by thickened visceral pleura.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, This was the most difficult part of the operation and it was very difficult to remove the parietal pleura without injuring the lung extensively.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," Finally, we were able to achieve this and after the corresponding lumen of the endotracheal tube was opened, we were able to inflate both the left upper and lower lobes of the lung satisfactorily."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, There was only one area towards the mediastinum that apparently I was not able to fill.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," This area, of course, was very rigid but any surgery in the direction __________ would have caused __________ injury, so I restrained from doing that."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, Two large chest tubes were placed.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, The cavity had been abundantly irrigated with warm saline.

Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, Samples were obtained from both the left and the right subbronchiole segments for Gram stain cultures and ASP evaluation.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," The right bronchus lower, middle, and upper were also examined and subsegmental bronchiole areas were thoroughly examined with no evidence of masses, lesions, or suspicious extrinsic compressions on the bronchi."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," At this point, all mucous secretions were thoroughly irrigated and aspirated until the airways were clear."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, Bronchoscope was then removed.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, Vital signs remained stable throughout this portion of the procedure.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, The patient was re-intubated by Anesthesia with a double lumen endotracheal tube.

Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, Pictures were taken.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," There is extensive fibrinous exudate noted under parietal and visceral pleura, encompassing the lung surface, diaphragm, and the posterolateral aspect of the right thorax."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," At this point, a second port site anteriorly was placed under direct visualization."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," With the aid of the thoracoscopic view, a Yankauer resection device was placed in the thorax and blunt decortication was performed and aspiration of reminder of the pleural fluid."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," Due to the gelatinous nature of the fibrinous exudate, there were areas of right upper lobe that adhered to the chest wall and the middle and lower lobes appeared entrapped."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," Due to the extensive nature of the disease, decision was made to open the chest in a formal right thoracotomy fashion."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, Incision was made.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," The subcutaneous tissues were then electrocauterized down to the level of the latissimus dorsi, which was separated with electrocautery down to the anterior 6th rib space."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, The chest cavity was entered with the right lung deflated per Anesthesia at our request.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," Once the intrathoracic cavity was accessed, a thorough decortication was performed in meticulous systematic fashion starting with the right upper lobe, middle, and the right lower lobe."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," With the expansion of the lung and reduction of the pleural surface fibrinous extubate, warm irrigation was used and the lungs allowed to re-expand."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, There was no evidence of gross leakage or bleeding at the conclusion of surgery.

Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, He was placed in a supine position on the operating table.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," After induction of general anesthesia and placement of a double lumen endotracheal tube, he was turned and placed in a right lateral decubitus position on a beanbag with appropriate padding and axillary roll."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, Left chest was prepped and draped in a usual sterile fashion.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," After administration of intravenous antibiotics, a left thoracotomy incision was made, dissection was carried down to the subcutaneous tissues, muscle layers down to the fifth interspace."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, The left lung was deflated and the pleural cavity entered.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, The Finochietto retractor was used to help provide exposure.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," The sixth rib was shingled in the posterior position and a careful expiration of the left pleural cavity was performed., Immediately encountered was left pleural fluid including some purulent fluid."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, Cultures of this were sampled and sent for microbiology analysis.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, The left pleural space was then copiously irrigated.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, A careful expiration demonstrated that the rupture appeared to be sealed.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, There was crepitus within the mediastinal cavity.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, The mediastinum was opened and explored and the esophagus was explored.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, The tissues of the esophagus appeared to show some friability and an area of the rupture in the distal esophagus.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, It was not possible to place any stitches in this tissue and instead a small intercostal flap was developed and placed to cover the area.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," The area was copiously irrigated, this provided nice coverage and repair."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," After final irrigation and inspection, two chest tubes were placed including a #36 French right angled tube at the diaphragm and a posterior straight #36 French."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, These were secured at the left axillary line region at the skin level with #0-silk.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary,", The intercostal sutures were used to close the chest wall with a #2 Vicryl sutures."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, Muscle layers were closed with running #1 Vicryl sutures.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, The wound was irrigated and the skin was closed with skin staples.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary,", The patient was then turned and placed in a supine position."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, A laparoscopic gastrostomy was performed and then a diagnostic laparoscopy performed.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," A Veress needle was carefully inserted into the abdomen, pneumoperitoneum was established in the usual fashion, a bladeless 5-mm separator trocar was introduced."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, The laparoscope was introduced.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, A single additional left-sided separator trocar was introduced.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," It was not possible to safely pass a nasogastric or orogastric tube, pass the stricture and perforation and so the nasogastric tube was left right at the level where there was some stricture or narrowing or resistance."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, The stomach however did have some air insufflation and we were able to place our T-fasteners through the anterior abdominal wall and through the anterior gastric wall safely.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, The skin incision was made and the gastric lumen was then accessed with the Seldinger technique.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, Guide wire was introduced into the stomach lumen and series of dilators was then passed over the guide wire.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, #18 French Gastrostomy was then passed into the stomach lumen and the balloon was inflated.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," We confirmed that we were in the gastric lumen and the balloon was pulled up, creating apposition of the gastric wall and the anterior abdominal wall."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, The T-fasteners were all crimped and secured into position.

Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, There was also noted to be some mild infiltrates of the right lung.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, The patient had a 30-year history of cigarette smoking.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," A chest tube was placed at the other hospital, which produced some brownish fluid that had foul odor, actually what was thought to be a fecal-like odor."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," Then an abdominal CT scan was done, which did not suggest any communication of the bowel into the pleural cavity or any other significant abnormalities in the abdomen on the abdominal CT."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," The patient was started on antibiotics and was then taken to the operating room, where there was to be a thoracoscopy performed."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," The patient had a flexible fiberoptic bronchoscopy that showed no endobronchial lesions, but there was bloody mucous in the left main stem bronchus and this was suctioned out."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, This was suctioned out with the addition of the use of saline ***** in the bronchus.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," Following the bronchoscopy, a double lumen tube was placed, but it was not possible to secure the double lumen to the place so we did not proceed with the thoracoscopy on that day.,"
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary,The patient was transferred for continued evaluation and treatment.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," Today, the double lumen tube was placed and there was some erythema of the mucosa noted in the airways in the bronchi and also remarkably bloody secretions were also noted."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," These were suctioned, but it was enough to produce a temporary obstruction of the left mainstem bronchus."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," Eventually, the double lumen tube was secured and an attempt at a left thoracoscopy was performed after the chest tube was removed and digital dissection was carried out through that."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," The chest tube tract, which was about in the sixth or seventh intercostal space, but it was not possible to dissect enough down to get a acceptable visualization through this tract."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, A second incision for thoracoscopy was made about on the sixth intercostal space in the midaxillary line and again some digital dissection was carried out but it was not enough to be able to achieve an opening or space for satisfactory inspection of the pleural cavity.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, Therefore the chest was opened and remarkable findings included a very dense consolidation of the entire lung such that it was very hard and firm throughout.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," Remarkably, the surface of the lower lobe laterally was not completely covered with a fibrotic line, but it was more the line anterior and posterior and more of it over the left upper lobe."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," There were many pockets of purulent material, which had a gray-white appearance to it."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, There was quite a bit of whitish fibrotic fibrinous deposit on the parietal pleura of the lung especially the upper lobe.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, The adhesions were taken down and they were quite bloody in some areas indicating that the process had been present for some time.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," There seemed to be an abscess that was about 3 cm in dimension, all the lateral basilar segment of the lower lobe near the area where the chest tube was placed."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, Many cultures were taken from several areas.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," The most remarkable finding was a large cavity, which was probably about 11 cm in dimension, containing grayish pus and also caseous-like material, it was thought to be perhaps necrotic lung tissue, perhaps a deposit related to tuberculosis in the cavity.,"
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary,"The apex of the lung was quite densely adhered to the parietal pleura there and the adhesions were quite thickened and firm., PROCEDURE AND TECHNIQUE:,  With the patient lying with the right side down on the operating table the left chest was prepped and draped in sterile manner."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," The chest tube had been removed and initially a blunt dissection was carried out through the old chest tube tract, but then it was necessary to enlarge it slightly in order to get the Thoracoport in place and this was done and as mentioned above we could not achieve the satisfactory visualization through this."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," Therefore, the next incision for Thoracoport and thoracoscopy insertion through the port was over the sixth intercostal space and a little bit better visualization was achieved, but it was clear that we would be unable to complete the procedure by thoracoscopy."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," Therefore posterolateral thoracotomy incision was made, entering the pleural space and what is probably the sixth intercostal space."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, Quite a bit of blunt and sharp and electrocautery dissection was performed to take down adhesions to the set of the fibrinous deposit on the pleural cavity.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, Specimens for culture were taken and specimens for permanent histology were taken and a frozen section of one of the most quite dense.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, Suture ligatures of Prolene were required.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," When the cavity was encountered it was due to some compression and dissection of some of the fibrinous deposit in the upper lobe laterally and anterior and this became identified as a very thin layer in one area over this abscess and when it was opened it was quite large and we unroofed it completely and there was bleeding down in the depths of the cavity, which appeared to be from pulmonary veins and these were sutured with a ""tissue pledget"" of what was probably intercostal nozzle and endothoracic fascia with Prolene sutures."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary,", Also as the upper lobe was retracted in caudal direction the tissue was quite dense and the superior branch of the pulmonary artery on the left side was torn and for hemostasis a 14-French Foley catheter was passed into the area of the tear and the balloon was inflated, which helped establish hemostasis and suturing was carried out again with utilizing a small pledget what was probably intercostal muscle and endothoracic fascia and this was sutured in place and the Foley catheter was removed."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, The patch was sutured onto the pulmonary artery tear.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, A similar maneuver was utilized on the pulmonary vein bleeding site down deep in the cavity.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," Also on the pulmonary artery repair some ***** material was used and also thrombin, Gelfoam and Surgicel."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, After reasonably good hemostasis was established pleural cavity was irrigated with saline.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," As mentioned, biopsies were taken from multiple sites on the pleura and on the edge and on the lung."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," Then two #24 Blake chest tubes were placed, one through a stab wound above the incision anteriorly and one below and one in the inferior pleural space and tubes were brought out through stab wounds necked into the skin with 0 silk."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, One was positioned posteriorly and the other anteriorly and in the cephalad direction of the apex.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, These were later connected to water-seal suction at 40 cm of water with negative pressure.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary,", Good hemostasis was observed."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, Sponge count was reported as being correct.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," Intercostal nerve blocks at probably the fifth, sixth, and seventh intercostal nerves was carried out."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, Then the sixth rib had been broken and with retraction the fractured ends were resected and rongeur used to smooth out the end fragments of this rib.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," Metallic clip was passed through the rib to facilitate passage of an intracostal suture, but the bone was partially fractured inferiorly and it was very difficult to get the suture out through the inner cortical table, so that pericostal sutures were used with #1 Vicryl."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, The chest wall was closed with running #1 Vicryl and then 2-0 Vicryl subcutaneous and staples on the skin.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, The chest tubes were connected to water-seal drainage with 40 cm of water negative pressure.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, Sterile dressings were applied.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, The patient tolerated the procedure well and was turned in the supine position where the double lumen endotracheal tube was switched out with single lumen.

Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, It was dissected free circumferentially.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," The aortic bifurcation was dissected free, dissecting free both iliac arteries."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," The left inferior pulmonary vein was then dissected free, and a pursestring of 4-0 Prolene was placed on this."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, The patient was heparinized.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," Through a stab wound in the center of this, a right-angle venous cannula was then placed at the left atrium and secured to a Rumel tourniquet."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, This was hooked to a venous inflow of left heart bypass machine.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," A pursestring of 4-0 Prolene was placed on the aneurysm and through a stab wound in the center of this, an arterial cannula was placed and hooked to outflow."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, Bypass was instituted.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," The aneurysm was cross clamped just above T10 and also, cross clamped just below the diaphragm."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, The area was divided at this point.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, A 26-mm graft was then sutured in place with running 3-0 Prolene suture.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, The graft was brought into the diaphragm.

Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," The aorta was opened longitudinally, going posterior between the left and right renal arteries, and it was completely transected at its bifurcation."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," The SMA, celiac and right renal artery were then dissected free as a complete island, and the left renal was dissected free as a complete Carrell patch."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," The island was laid in the graft for the visceral liner, and it was sutured in place with running 4-0 Prolene suture with pledgetted 4-0 Prolene sutures around the circumference."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," The clamp was then moved below the visceral vessels, and the clamp on the chest was removed, re-establishing flow to the visceral vessels."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, The graft was cut to fit the bifurcation and sutured in place with running 3-0 Prolene suture.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," All clamps were removed, and flow was re-established."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, An 8-mm graft was sutured end-to-end to the Carrell patch and to the left renal.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, A partial-occlusion clamp was placed.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, An area of graft was removed.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, The end of the graft was cut to fit this and sutured in place with running Prolene suture.

Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, Posteriorly a pedunculated 2.5 x 3-cm pleural-based mass was identified on the anterior chest wall.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," There were thin adhesions to the pleura, but no invasion of the chest wall that could be identified."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," The tumor was very mobile and was on a pedunculated stalk, approximately 1.5 cm."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, It was felt that this could be resected without the need of chest wall reconstruction because of the narrow stalk.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary,", Therefore a 2nd port was placed in the anterior axillary line approximately 8th intercostal space in the usual fashion."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, Camera was placed through this port.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," Laparoscopic scissors were placed through the posterior port, but it was necessary to have another instrument to provide more tension than just gravity."

Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, The area of the right femoral artery was prepped and draped in a sterile fashion.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," Using the percutaneous technique, a 6-French sheath was placed in the right femoral artery under fluoroscopic guidance."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," With the guidewire in place, a 5-French JL-4 catheter was used to selectively angiogram the left coronary system."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, The catheter was removed.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, The sheath flushed.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, The 5-French 3DRC catheter was then used to selectively angiogram the right coronary artery.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," The cath removed, the sheath flushed."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary,", It was decided that intervention was needed in the severe lesions in the LAD, which appeared to be the culprit lesions for the non-ST elevation-MI."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," The patient was given a bolus of heparin and an ACT of approximately 50 seconds was obtained, we rebolused and the ACT was slightly lower."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, We repeated the level and it was slightly higher.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, We administered 500 more units of heparin and then proceeded with an ACT of approximately 270 seconds prior to the 500 units of heparin IV.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," Additionally, the patient had been given 300 mg of Plavix orally during the procedure and Integrilin IV bolus and then maintenance drip was started.,"
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary,A 6-French CLS 3.5 left coronary guide catheter was used to cannulate the left main and HEW guidewire was positioned in the distal LAD and another HEW guidewire in the relatively large third diagonal.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, An Apex 2.5 x 15 mm balloon was positioned in the distal portion of the mid LAD stenosis and inflated to 6 atmospheres for 15 seconds and then deflated.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," Angiography was then performed, demonstrated marked improvement in the stenosis and this image was used for sizing the last of the needed stent."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," The balloon was pulled more proximally and then inflated again at 6 atmospheres for approximately 20 seconds, with the proximal end of the balloon positioned distal to the origin of the third diagonal so as to not compromise the ostium."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," The balloon was inflated and removed, repeat angiography performed."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," We attempted to advance a Driver 2.5 x 24 mm bare metal stent, but I could not advance it beyond the proximal LAD, where there was significant calcification."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, The stent was removed.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, Attempts to advance the same 2.5 x 15 mm Apex balloon that was previously used were unsuccessful.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," It was removed, a new Apex 2.5 x 15 mm balloon was then positioned in the proximal LAD and inflated to 6 atmospheres for 15 seconds and then deflated and advanced slightly with the distal tip of the balloon proximal to the third diagonal ostium and it was inflated to 6 atmospheres for 15 seconds and then deflated and removed."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, Repeat angiography demonstrated no evidence of dissection.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," One more attempt was made to advance the Driver 2.5 x 24 mm bare metal stent, but again I could not advance it beyond the calcified plaque in the proximal LAD and this was despite the presence of the buddy wire in the diagonal."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," I felt that further attempts in this calcified vessel in a 90-year-old with severe aortic stenosis and severe aortic insufficiency would likely result in complications of dissection, so the stent was removed."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, The guidewires and guide cath were removed.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, The sheath flushed and sutured into position.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, The patient moved to ICU in stable condition with no chest discomfort at all.

Cardiovascular / Pulmonary,", The LAD is a moderate-to-large vessel, giving rise to small diagonals and then a moderate-to-large third diagonal, and then a small fourth diagonal."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, The LAD has significant calcification proximally.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, There is a 50% stenosis between the first and second diagonals that we treated with angioplasty alone in an attempt to be able to advance the stent.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," This resulted in a 30% residual, mostly eccentric calcified plaque."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," Following this, there was a 50% stenosis in the LAD just after the takeoff of the third diagonal."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, This was not ballooned.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, Beyond this is an 80% stenosis prior to the fourth diagonal and then a 99% stenosis after the fourth diagonal.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, These 2 lesions were dilated with 10% residual prior to the fourth diagonal and 25% residual distal to the fourth diagonal.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," As noted above, this area was not stented because I could not safely advance the stent."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," Note, there was also a 50% stenosis at the origin of the moderate-to-large third diagonal that did not change with angioplasty."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary,", The circumflex is a large, nondominant vessel consisting of a large obtuse marginal with multiple branches."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, The proximal circumflex has an eccentric 60% stenosis prior to the takeoff of the obtuse marginal.

Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, He had epicardial pacing wires removed at the bedside.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," Shortly afterwards, he began to feel lightheaded and became pale and diaphoretic."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, He was immediately rushed to the operating room for cardiac tamponade following removal of epicardial pacing wires.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, He was transported immediately and emergently and remained awake and alert throughout the time period inspite of hypotension with the systolic pressure in the 60s-70s.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary,", DETAILS OF PROCEDURE:  , The patient was taken emergently to the operating room and placed supine on the operating room table."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, His chest was prepped and draped prior to induction under general anesthesia.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, Incision was made through the previous median sternotomy chest incision.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, Wires were removed in the usual manner and the sternum was retracted.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, There were large amounts of dark blood filling the mediastinal chest cavity.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, Large amounts of clot were also removed from the pericardial well and chest.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, Systematic exploration of the mediastinum and pericardial well revealed bleeding from the right atrial appendix at the site of the previous cannulation.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, This was repaired with two horizontal mattress pledgeted #5-0 Prolene sutures.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, An additional #0 silk tie was also placed around the base of the atrial appendage for further hemostasis.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, No other sites of bleeding were identified.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, The mediastinum was then irrigated with copious amounts of antibiotic saline solution.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," Two chest tubes were then placed including an angled chest tube into the pericardial well on the inferior border of the heart, as well as straight mediastinal chest tube."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, The sternum was then reapproximated with stainless steel wires in the usual manner and the subcutaneous tissue was closed in multiple layers with running Vicryl sutures.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, The skin was then closed with a running subcuticular stitch.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, The patient was then taken to the Intensive Care Unit in a critical but stable condition.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary,"CLINICAL HISTORY:,  A 48-year-old smoker found to have a right upper lobe mass on chest x-ray and is being evaluated for chest pain."

Lymph node biopsy, level 7 subcarinal showing (5) lymph nodes with anthracosis and no metastatic tumor., COMMENT:  , The morphology of the tumor seen in both lobes is similar and we feel that the smaller tumor involving the right lower lobe is most likely secondary to transbronchial spread from the main tumor involving the right upper lobe."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," This suggestion is supported by the fact that no obvious vascular or lymphatic invasion is demonstrated and adjacent to the smaller tumor, there is isolated nests of tumor cells within the air spaces."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," Furthermore, immunoperoxidase stain for Ck-7, CK-20 and TTF are performed on both the right lower and right upper lobe nodule."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," The immunohistochemical results confirm the lung origin of both tumors and we feel that the tumor involving the right lower lobe is due to transbronchial spread from the larger tumor nodule involving the right upper lobe.,"

Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, He promptly underwent appropriate treatment in interventional radiology with the above-noted angioplasty and placement of a vena caval filter followed by mechanical and pharmacologic thrombolysis.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, Repeat ultrasound there on 02/20/2007 showed no evidence of deep venous thrombosis (DVT).
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, Continuous intravenous unfractionated heparin infusion was continued.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," Because there was no obvious cause of this extensive thrombosis, occult malignancy was suspected."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, Appropriate blood studies were obtained and he underwent a PET/CT scan as part of his diagnostic evaluation.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, This study showed moderately increased diffuse bone marrow metabolic activity.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," Because the WBC continued to rise and showed a preponderance of lymphocytes, the smear was reviewed by pathologist, Sheryl Asplund, M.D., and flow cytometry was performed on the peripheral blood."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," These studies became available the afternoon of 02/23/2007, and confirmed the diagnosis of precursor-B acute lymphoblastic leukemia."

Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," Next, the patient was placed in the left lateral decubitus position, and his right chest was prepped and draped in the standard surgical fashion."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, We used a #10-blade scalpel to make an incision in the skin approximately 1 fingerbreadth below the angle of the scapula.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, Dissection was carried down in a muscle-sparing fashion using Bovie electrocautery.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," The 5th rib was counted, and the 6th interspace was entered."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, The lung was deflated.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, We identified the major fissure.

Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," After taking the pulmonary artery branches of the right upper lobe of the lung, we used a combination of blunt dissection and sharp dissection with Metzenbaum scissors to separate out the pulmonary vein branch of the right upper lobe of the lung."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, This likewise was ligated with a 0 silk.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, It was stick-tied with a 2-0 silk.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, It was then divided.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, Next we dissected out the bronchial branch to the right upper lobe of the lung.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, A curved Glover was placed around the bronchus.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, Next a TA-30 stapler was fired across the bronchus.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, The bronchus was divided with a #10-blade scalpel.

Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, The final frozen pathology on this entire area returned as negative for tumor.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," Additional chest wall abnormalities were biopsied and sent for pathologic analysis, and these all returned separately as negative for tumor and only fibrotic tissue."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, Several other biopsies were taken and sent for permanent analysis of the chest wall.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, All of the biopsy sites were additionally marked with Hemoclips.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, The right middle lobe lesion was accompanied with distal pneumonitis and otherwise no direct involvement of the right upper lobe or right lower lobe.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary,", ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: , Less than 100 mL., CONDITION OF THE PATIENT AFTER SURGERY: ,"
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary,"Stable., HISTORY OF PROCEDURE:,  This patient is well known to our service."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, He was admitted the night before surgery and given hemodialysis and had close blood sugar monitoring in control.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," The patient was subsequently taken to the operating room on April 4, 2007, was given general anesthesia and was endotracheally intubated without incident."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," Although, he had markedly difficult airway, the patient had fiberoptic bronchoscopy performed all the way down to the level of the subsegmental bronchi."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," No abnormalities were noted in the entire tracheobronchial tree, and based on this, the decision was made to proceed with the surgery."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," The patient was kept in the supine position, and the single-lumen endotracheal tube was removed and a double-lumen tube was placed."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," Following this, the patient was placed into the left lateral decubitus position with the right side up and all pressure points were padded."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, Sterile DuraPrep preparation on the right chest was placed.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, A sterile drape around that was also placed.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, The table was flexed to open up the intercostal spaces.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, A second bronchoscopy was performed to confirm placement of the double-lumen endotracheal tube.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, Marcaine was infused into all incision areas prior to making an incision.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, The incisions for the VATS right middle lobectomy included a small 1-cm incision for the auscultatory incision approximately 4 cm inferior to the inferior tip of the scapula.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, The camera port was in the posterior axillary line in the eighth intercostal space through which a 5-mm 30-degree scope was used.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," Third incision was an anterior port, which was approximately 2 cm inferior to the inframammary crease and the midclavicular line in the anterior sixth intercostal space, and the third incision was a utility port, which was a 4 cm long incision, which was approximately one rib space below the superior pulmonary vein."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, All of these incisions were eventually created during the procedure.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," The initial incision was the camera port through which, under direct visualization, an additional small 5-mm port was created just inferior to the anterior port."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," These two ports were used to identify the chest wall lesions, which were initially thought to be metastatic lesions."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," Multiple biopsies of the chest wall lesions were taken, and the decision was made to also insert the auscultatory incision port."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," Through these three incisions, the initial working of the diagnostic portion of the chest wall lesion was performed."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, Multiple biopsies were taken of the entire chest wall offers and specimens came back as negative.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, The right middle lobe was noted to be adherent to the anterior chest wall.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, This area was taken down and the entire pleural surface along this area was taken down and sent for frozen pathologic analysis.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," This also returned as negative with only fibrotic tissue and a few lymphocytes within the fibrotic tissue, but no tumor cells."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," Based on this, the decision was made to not proceed with chest wall resection and continue with right middle lobectomy."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," Following this, the anterior port was increased in size and the utility port was made and meticulous dissection from an anterior to posterior direction was performed."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, The middle lobe branch of the right superior pulmonary vein was initially dissected and stapled with vascular load 45-mm EndoGIA stapler.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," Following division of the right superior pulmonary vein, the right middle lobe bronchus was easily identified."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," Initially, this was thought to be the main right middle lobe bronchus, but in fact it was the medial branch of the right middle lobe bronchus."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, This was encircled and divided with a blue load stapler with a 45-mm EndoGIA.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," Following division of this, the pulmonary artery was easily identified."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, Two branches of the pulmonary artery were noted to be going into the right middle lobe.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, These were individually divided with a vascular load after encircling with a right angle clamp.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," The vascular staple load completely divided these arterial branches successfully from the main pulmonary artery trunk, and following this, an additional branch of the bronchus was noted to be going to the right middle lobe."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, A fiberoptic bronchoscopy was performed intraoperatively and confirmed that this was in fact the lateral branch of the right middle lobe bronchus.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, This was divided with a blue load stapler 45 mm EndoGIA.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," Following division of this, the minor and major fissures were completed along the edges of the right middle lobe separating the right upper lobe from the right middle lobe as well as the right middle lobe from the right lower lobe."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," Following complete division of the fissure, the lobe was put into an EndoGIA bag and taken out through the utility port."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," Following removal of the right middle lobe, a meticulous lymph node dissection sampling was performed excising the lymph node package in the 4R area as well as the 7 lymph node package."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," Node station 8 or 9 nodes were easily identified, therefore none were taken."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, The patient was allowed to ventilate under water on the right lung with no obvious air leaking noted.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, A 19-French Blake was placed into the posterior apical position and a 32-French chest tube was placed in the anteroapical position.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," Following this, the patient's lung was allowed to reexpand fully, and the patient was checked for air leaking once again."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," Following this, all the ports were closed with 2-0 Vicryl suture used for the deeper tissue, and 3-0 Vicryl suture was used to reapproximate the subcutaneous tissue and 4-0 Monocryl suture was used to close the skin in a running subcuticular fashion."

Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," After an adequate general anesthesia was given, she was placed in the left lateral decubitus and the right chest was prepped and draped in the sterile fashion."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," Lateral thoracotomy was performed on the right side anterior to the tip of the scapula, and this was carried down through the subcutaneous tissue."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, The latissimus dorsi muscle was partially transected and then the serratus was reflected anteriorly.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, The chest was entered through the fifth intercostal space.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, A retractor was placed and then extensive number of adhesions between the lung and the pleura were lysed carefully with sharp and blunt dissection.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, The right lower lobe was identified.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," There was a large mass in the superior segment of the lobe, which was very close to the right upper lobe, and because of the adhesions, it could not be told if the tumor was extending into the right upper lobe, but it appeared that it did not."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," Dissection was then performed at the lower lobe of the fissure, and a GIA stapler was placed through here to separate the tumor from the upper lobe including a small segment of the upper lobe with the lower lobe."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," Then, dissection of the hilum was performed, and the branches of the pulmonary artery to the lower lobe were ligated with #2-0 silk freehand ties proximally and distally and #3-0 silk transfixion stitches and then transected."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," The inferior pulmonary vein was dissected after dividing the ligament, and it was stapled proximally and distally with a TA30 stapler and then transected."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, Further dissection of the fissure allowed for its completion with a GIA stapler and then the bronchus was identified and dissected.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," The bronchus was stapled with a TA30 bronchial stapler and then transected, and the specimen was removed and sent to the Pathology Department for frozen section diagnosis."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," The frozen section diagnosis was that of non-small cell carcinoma, bronchial margins free and pleural margins free."

Cardiovascular / Pulmonary,"CHART NOTE:,  She is here to discuss possible open lung biopsy that she has actually scheduled for tomorrow."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, Dr. XYZ had seen her because of her complaints of shortness of breath.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, Then she had the pulmonary function test and CT scan
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary,"and he felt that she probably had usual interstitial pneumonitis, but wanted her to have an open lung biopsy so he had her see Dr. XYZ Estep."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, He had concurred with Dr. XYZ that an open lung biopsy was appropriate and she was actually scheduled for this but both Dr. XYZ
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary,and I were unavailable before the procedure was originally scheduled so he had it delayed so that she could talk with us prior to having the biopsy.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, She was ready to go ahead with this and felt that it was important she find out why she is short of breath.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, She is very concerned about the findings on her CAT scan and pulmonary function test.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, She seemed alarmed to report that Dr. XYZ had found that her lung capacity was reduced to 60% of what should be normal.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," However, I told her that two years ago Dr. XYZ did pulmonary function studies which showed the same change in function."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," And that really her pulmonary function test, at least compared from two years ago, had not really changed over this period of time."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," After discussing the serious nature of an open lung biopsy, the fact that her pulmonary function studies have not changed in two years, the fact that she likely has a number of other things that are contributing to her being out of breath, which is deconditioning and obesity, she seemed comfortable with the thought of simply monitoring this a little bit longer before undergoing something as risky as an open lung biopsy."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," In fact when I called Dr. XYZ to talk to him about cancelling the procedure, he stated he would be very uncomfortable with doing an open lung biopsy on someone with pulmonary function studies which had not changed."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, I also explained to patient that I did not think Dr. XYZ was aware that she had had pulmonary function studies two years previously and certainly did not know that there results of those.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," And also I spoke with Dr. XYZ who agreed that although the two different tests may have some minor differences accounting for some of the similarity in results that may or may not be completely accurate, that generally a person with progressive interstitial lung disease without a fairly substantial change on pulmonary function tests even if they were done at different facilities."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary,", I had a 30-minute discussion with patient about all of this and showed her the different test results and had a lengthy talk with her about the open lung biopsy and she ultimately felt very uncomfortable with going ahead and decided to cancel it."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," I also told her we could continue to monitor her breathing problems and continue to monitor her CAT scan, x-ray, and pulmonary function tests."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," And if there was some sign that this was a progressive problem, she could still go ahead with the lung biopsy."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, But she needed to understand that the treatment and likely diagnosis found from an open lung biopsy were not highly likely to be of any great help to her.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, She understands that the diagnoses made from open lung biopsy are not all that specific and that the treatment for the few specific things that can be detected are not often well tolerated or extremely helpful.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary,", We are going to see her back in a month to see how her breathing is doing."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, We will cancel her open lung biopsy for tomorrow and decide whether she should follow up with a pulmonologist at that time.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, I told her I would try to talk to her sister sometime in the next day or two.

Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," I believe at this time that it is too risky to use Coumadin in her case because of her age and comorbidities, the multiple medications that she takes and it is very difficult to keep an adequate level of anticoagulation that is safe for her."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, She is prone to a fall and this would be a big problem.

Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," After informed consent, he was medicated with Versed and fentanyl."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," The right groin was prepped and draped, and infiltrated with 2% Xylocaine."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," Percutaneously, #6-French arterial sheath was placed."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, Selective native left and right coronary angiography was performed followed by left ventricular angiography.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, The patient had a totally occluded right coronary.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, We initially started with a JR4 guide.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, We were able to a sport wire through the total occlusion and saw a very tight stenosis.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, We were able to get a 30 x 13 mm power saver balloon into the stenosis and dilated.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," We then attempted to put a 30 x 12 mm stent across the stenosis, but we had very little guide support, the guide kept coming out."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, We then switched to an AL1 guide and that too did not enable us to get anything to cross this lesion.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," We finally had to go an AL2 guide, we were concerned that this could cause some proximal dissection."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," That guided seated, we did have initial difficulty getting the wire back across the stenosis, and we did see a little staining suggesting we did have some tearing from the guide tip."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," The surgeons were put on notice in case we could not get this vessel open, but we were able to re-cross with a sport wire."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," We then re-dilated the area of stenosis and with good guide support, we were able to get a 30 x 23 mm Vision stent, where the lesion was and post-dilated it to 18 atmospheres."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," Routine angiography did show that the distal posterolateral branch seems to be occluded, whether this was from distal wire dissection or distal thrombosis was unclear, but we were able to re-wire that area and get a 25 x12 Vision balloon and dilate the area and re-establish flow to the small segment."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, We then came back because of the residual dissection proximal to the first stent and put a 30 x15 mm Vision stent at 18 atmospheres.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, Final angiography showed resolution of the dissection.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, We could see a little staining extrinsic to the stent.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, No perforation and excellent flow.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," During the intervention, we did give a bolus and drip of Angiomax."

Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, The first obtuse marginal had a long 50% narrowing and then the AV groove branch was free of any disease.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, Some mild collaterals to the right were seen.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," Right coronary angiography revealed a total occlusion of the right coronary, just about 0.5 cm after its origin."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," After we got a wire across the area of occlusion, we could see some thrombosis and a 99% stenosis just at the curve."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," Following the balloon angioplasty, we established good flow down the distal vessel."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, We still had about residual 70% stenosis.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," When we had to go back with the AL2 guide, we could see a little bit of staining in the proximal portion of the vessel that we did not notice previously and we felt that the tip of the guide caused a little bit of intimal dissection."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, We re-dilated and then deployed.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, Repeat angiography now did show some hang up off dye distally.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," We never did have the wire that far down, so this was probably felt to be due to distal embolization of some thrombus."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," After deploying the stent, we had total resolution of the original lesion."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," We then directed our attention to the posterolateral branch, which the remainder of the vessel was patent giving off a large PDA."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, The posterolateral branch appeared to be occluded in its mid portion.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, We got a wire through and dilated this.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, We then came back and put a second stent in the proximal area of the right coronary proximal and abutting to the previous stent.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," Repeat angiography now showed no significant dissection, a little bit of contrast getting extrinsic to the stent probably in a little subintimal pouch, but this was excluded by the stent."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, There were no filling defects in the stent and excellent flow.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," The distal posterolateral branch did open up, although it was little under-filled and there may have been some mild residual disease there., IMPRESSION: , Atherosclerotic heart disease with total occlusion of right coronary, successfully stented to zero residual with repair of a small proximal dissection."

Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, We then transected the proximal portion of the stomach with Metzenbaum scissors.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, We secured our pursestring and then placed a 28 anvil in the divided proximal portion of the esophagus.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, The pursestring was then tied down without difficulty.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," Next, we tabularized our stomach using a #80 GIA stapler."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," After doing so, we chose a portion of the stomach more distally and opened it using Bovie electrocautery."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, We placed our EEA stapler through it and then punched out through the gastric wall.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, We connected our anvil to the EEA stapler.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, This was then secured appropriately.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, We checked to make sure that there was appropriate muscle apposition.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, We then fired the stapler.

Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," I have reviewed again with him in detail regarding risks, benefits, and alternatives of proceeding with cardioversion, which the patient is in favor of."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," After in depth explanation of the procedure with him that there would be more definitive resumption of normal sinus rhythm by using electrocardioversion with less long-term side effects, past the acute procedure, alternatives being continued atrial flutter with potential for electrophysiologic consultation for ablation and/or heart rate control with anticoagulation, which the patient was not interested nor was I primarily recommending as the next step, and risks including, but not limited to and the patient was aware and this was all done in the presence of his wife that this is not an all-inclusive list, but the risks include but not limited to oversedation from conscious sedation, risk of aspiration pneumonia from regurgitation of stomach contents, which would be less likely as I did confirm with the patient that he had been n.p.o."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary,"for greater than 15 hours, risk of induction of other arrhythmias including tachyarrhythmias requiring further management including cardioversion or risk of bradyarrhythmias, in the past when we had a cardioverter with 150 joules, he did have a 5.5-second pause especially while he is on antiarrhythmic therapy, statistically less significant risk of CVA, although we cannot really make that null."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," The patient expressed understanding of this risk, benefit, and alternative analysis."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," I invited questions from him and his wife and once their questions were answered to their self-stated satisfaction, we planned to go forward with the procedure., PROCEDURE NOTE:  , The patient received a total of 7 mg of Versed and 50 micrograms of fentanyl utilizing titrate-down sedation with good effect and this was after the appropriate time-out procedure had been done as per the Medical Center universal protocol with appropriate identification of the patient, position, procedure documentation, procedure indication, and there were no questions."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, The patient did actively participate in this time-out procedure.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," After the universal protocol was done, he then received the cardioversion attempt with 50 joules using ""lollipop posterior patch"" with hands-driven paddle on the side, which was 50 joules of synchronized biphasic energy."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," There was successful resumption of normal sinus rhythm, in fact this time there was not a significant pause as compared to when he had this done previously in late 12/09 and this sinus rhythm was confirmed by a 12-lead EKG., IMPRESSION: , Cardioversion shows successful resumption of normal sinus rhythm from atrial flutter and that is while the patient has been maintained on Coumadin and his INR is 3.22."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," We are going to watch him and discharge him from the Medical Center area on his current flecainide of 200 mg in the morning and 100 mg in the evening, atenolol 25 mg once a day, Coumadin _____ as currently being diagnosed."

Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," Initially, the patient was intubated with a #6 French tube because of the presence of previous laryngectomy."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," Because of this, I proceeded to use a pediatric bronchoscope, which provided limited visualization, but I was able to see the trachea and the carina and both left and right bronchial systems without significant pathology, although there was some mucus secretion that was aspirated.,"
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary,"Then, with the patient properly anesthetized and looking very stable, we decided to insert a larger endotracheal tube that allowed for the insertion of the regular adult bronchoscope."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," Therefore, we were able to obtain a better visualization and see the trachea and the carina that were normal and also the left and right bronchial systems."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," Some brownish secretions were obtained, particularly from the right side and were sent for culture and sensitivity, both aerobic and anaerobic fungi and acid fast.,"
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary,"Then, the patient was turned with left side up and prepped for a left thoracotomy."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, He was properly draped.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, I had recently re-inspected the CT of the chest and decided to make a limited thoracotomy of about 6 cm or so in the midaxillary line about the sixth intercostal space.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," Immediately, it was evident that there was a large amount of pus in the left chest."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, We proceeded to insert the suction catheters and we rapidly obtained about 1400 mL of frank pus.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," Then, we proceeded to open the intercostal space a bit more with a Richardson retractor and it was immediately obvious that there was an abundant amount of solid exudate throughout the lung."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, We spent several minutes trying to clean up this area.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," Initially, I had planned only to drain the empyema because the patient was in a very poor condition, but at this particular moment, he was more stable and well oxygenated, and the situation was such that we were able to perform a partial pulmonary decortication where we broke up a number of loculations that were present and we were able to separate the lung from the diaphragm and also the pulmonary fissure."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," On the upper part of the chest, we had limited access, but overall we obtained a large amount of solid exudate and we were able to break out loculations."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," We followed by irrigation with 2000 cc of warm normal saline and then insertion of two #32 chest tubes, which are the largest one available in this institution; one we put over the diaphragm and the other one going up and down towards the apex."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary,", The limited thoracotomy was closed with heavy intercostal sutures of Vicryl, then interrupted sutures of #0 Vicryl to the muscle layers, and I loosely approximately the skin with a few sutures of nylon because I am suspicious that the incision may become infected because he has been exposed to intrapleural pus.,"
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary,The chest tubes were secured with sutures and then connected to Pleur-evac.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," Then, the patient was transported."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary,", Estimated blood loss was minimal and the patient tolerated the procedure well."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, He was extubated in the operating room and he was transferred to the ICU to be admitted.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, A chest x-ray was ordered stat.

Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, The patient had a chest x-ray and based on that there is concern by the Radiology it could be a foreign body in the right main stem.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," The patient has been taken to the operating room for rigid bronchoscopy and foreign body removal., DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  , The patient was taken to the operating room, placed supine, put under general mask anesthesia."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, Using a 3.5 rigid bronchoscope we visualized between the cords into the trachea.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, There were some secretions but that looked okay.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, Got down at the level of the carina to see a foreign body flapping in the right main stem.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, I then used graspers to grasp to try to pull into the scope itself.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," I could not do that, I thus had to pull the scope out along with the foreign body that was held on to with a grasper."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, It appeared to be consisting of some type of plastic piece that had broke off some different object.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, I took the scope and put it back down into the airway again.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," Again, there was secretion in the trachea that we suctioned out."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, We looked down into the right bronchus intermedius.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," There was no other pathology noted, just some irritation in the right main stem area."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, I looked down the left main stem as well and that looked okay as well.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, I then withdrew the scope.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, Trachea looked fine as well as the cords.

Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," This morning, the patient developed worsening hypoxia with abundant sputum production requiring frequent suctioning from his ET tube."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, The patient also had new-appearing atelectasis versus infiltrates in the right lower lobe of his lung on chest x-ray.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," Given these findings, it was felt that bronchoscopy could further define source of secretions and send more appropriate specimen for culture if need be., OPERATION:,  The patient was given additional fentanyl, Versed as well as paralytics for the procedure."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, Small bronchoscope was inserted through the ET tube and to the trachea to the level of carina.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, There was noted to be thick clear secretions adherent to the trachea walls as well as into the right mainstem bronchus.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, Extensive secretions extended down into the secondary airways.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, This was lavaged with saline and suctioned dry.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," There is no overt specific occlusion of airways, nor was there any purulent-appearing sputum."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," The bronchoscope was then advanced into the left mainstem bronchus, and there was noted to be a small amount of similar-appearing secretions which was likewise suctioned and cleaned."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," The bronchoscope was removed, and the patient was increased to PEEP of 10 on the ventilator."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," Please note that prior to starting bronchoscopy, he was pre oxygenated with 100% O2."

Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, A rapid sequence induction was done.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, He was intubated with a rigid scope.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, Jet ventilation technique was carried out using a rigid and flexible scope.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," A thorough airway inspection was carried out with findings as described above., Dr. D was present in the operating room and we conferred on operative strategy and agreed that the best of strategy would be to first dilate the right main bronchus, cauterize it to control bleeding and then piecemeal removed the stent from distal to proximal."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, This is the technique that was carried out in a painstaking fashion removing bits of the stent piecemeal with finally getting all of the visible stent out of the airway.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, It should be noted that Dr. Donovan and I felt that two of the metallic stents were probably in place but we cannot be sure because of the terrible anatomy and the fact that the stent pieces were coming out twisted metal in fragments.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," Nevertheless, all the visible stent was removed, and the airway was much better after with the dilation of balloon and the rigid scope."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," We took measurements and decided to place stents in the trachea, left and right main bronchus using a Dumon Y-stent."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, It was measured 18 mm in tracheal diameter and 14 mm in bronchial diameter.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," The right main stem stent was 2.25 cm in length, the left main stem stent was 3 cm in length and the tracheal portion was 9 cm in length."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," After it was placed, excellent placement was achieved with the proximal end of the stent 3 cm below the true vocal cords."

Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, We examined the superior mediastinum.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, No lymph nodes were demonstrated as well as in the anterior mediastinum.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," Direction was then moved to the fascia where by utilizing sharp and blunt dissection, lingual artery was separated into the left upper lobe."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," Casual dissection was carried out with superior segmental arteries and left lower lobe was examined., Dissection was carried out around the pulmonary artery thus exposing the posterior artery to the left upper lobe."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, Direction was carried out to the superior pulmonary vein and utilizing sharp and blunt dissection the entire superior pulmonary vein was separated from the surrounding tissue.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," From the top side, the bronchus was then separated away from the pulmonary artery anteriorly, thus exposing the apical posterior artery, which was short."

Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, A minimal dissection plane measuring less than 1 cm was identified at the proximal area of dilatation.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, No further significant abnormality was identified.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, To avoid placing a stent in the small vessel I left it alone and approached the popliteal artery.

Cardiovascular / Pulmonary,and she is somnolent at that time.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," She does have chronic atrial fibrillation again documented at least present since 2007 and I found an EKG report by Dr. X, which shows atrial fibrillation on 08/29/07 per her report."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, One of the questions we were asked was whether the patient would be a candidate for Coumadin.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," Clearly given her history of small mini-strokes, I think Coumadin would be appropriate given this chronic atrial fibrillation, but the main issue is the fall risk."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, If not felt to be significant fall risk then I would strongly recommend Coumadin as the patient herself states that she has only fallen twice in the past year.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," I would defer that decision to Dr. Z and Dr. XY who know the patient well and it may be that physical therapy consult is appropriate to help adjudicate., RECOMMENDATIONS:, 1."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," Fall assessment as per Dr. Z and Dr. XY with possible PT consult if felt appropriate and if the patient is not felt to be at significant fall risk, would put her on Coumadin."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," Given her history of small strokes as documented in the chart and her chronic atrial fibrillation, she does have reasonable heart rate control on current labetalol., 2."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," The patient has elevated BNP and I suspect that is due to her severe pulmonary hypertension and renal failure and in the light of normal LV function, I would not make any further evaluation of that other than aggressive diuresis., 3."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," Regarding this minimal troponin elevation, I do not feel this is a diagnosis especially in the setting of pulmonary hypertension and her small-to-moderate sized stable pericardial effusion again that has been longstanding since 2007 from what I can tell and there is no evidence of tamponade."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, I would defer to her usual cardiologist Dr. X whether an outpatient stress evaluation is appropriate for risk stratification.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," I did find that the patient had a prior cardiac stress test in 08/07 where they felt that there was some subtle reversibility of the anterior wall, but it was felt that it may be artifact rather than true ischemia with normal LV function seen on that study as well., 4."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," Continue Norvasc for history of hypertension as well as labetalol., 5."

Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, He is also known to have severe calcific disease involving the entire left external iliac system as well as the common femoral and deep femoral arteries.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary,", Our initial plan today was to perform an atherectomy with angioplasty and stenting of the left superficial femoral artery as necessary."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," However, whenever we started the procedure, it became clear that there was a severe stenosis of the left superficial femoral artery at its takeoff from the left common femoral artery."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, The area was severely calcified including the external iliac artery extending up underneath the left inguinal ligament.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," Indeed, this ultimately was dissected due to manipulation of sheath catheters and sheath through the area."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," Ultimately, this wound up being a much more complex case than initially anticipated.,"
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary,"Because of the above, we ultimately performed a laser atherectomy of the left superficial femoral artery, which then had to be angioplastied to obtain a satisfactory result."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," The completion angiogram showed that there was a dissection of the left external iliac artery, which precluded flow down into the left lower extremity."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, We then had to come up and perform angioplasty and stenting of the left external iliac artery as well as aggressively dilating the takeoff of the less superficial femoral artery from the common femoral artery.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary,", The left superficial femoral artery was dilated with a 6-mm balloon.,"
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary,The left external iliac artery and common femoral arteries were dilated with an 8-mm balloon.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary,", A 2.5-mm ClearPath laser probe was used to initially arthrectomize and debulk the superficial femoral artery starting at its takeoff from the common femoral artery and extending down to the tight stenotic area in the upper one-third of the thigh."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," After the laser atherectomy was performed, the area still did not look good and so an angioplasty was then done, which looked good; however, as noted above, after we had dealt with the superficial femoral artery, we then had proximal inflow problems, which had to be dealt by angioplasty and stenting."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary,", The patient had good dorsalis pedis pulses bilaterally upon completion."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary,", The right common femoral artery was used for access in an up-and-over technique., PROCEDURE: , With the patient in the supine position under general anesthesia, the abdomen and lower extremities were prepped and draped in the sterile fashion."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary,", The right common femoral artery was punctured percutaneously, and a #5-French sheath was initially placed."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, We used a pigtail catheter to go up and over the aortic bifurcation and placed a stiff Amplatz guidewire down into the left common femoral artery.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, We then heparinized the patient and placed a #7-French Raby sheath over the Amplatz wire.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, A selective left lower extremity angiogram was then done with the above-noted findings.
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary,", We then used a ClearPath 2.5-mm laser probe to laser the proximal superficial femoral artery."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," Because of the findings as noted above, this became more involved than initially hoped for."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," Once the laser atherectomy had been completed, the vessel still did not look good, so we used a 6-mm balloon to thoroughly dilate the area."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," Once that had been done, it looked good and we performed what we felt would be a completion angiogram only to find out that we had a more proximal problem precluding flow down into the left femoral artery.,"
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary,"Once that was discovered, we then had to proceed with angioplasty and stenting of the left external iliac artery right down to the acetabular level.,"
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary,"Once we had dealt with our run-on problems, we then did another completion angiogram, which showed a good flow through the entire area and down into the left lower extremity.,"
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary,"Following completion of the above, all wires, sheaths, and catheters were removed from the right common femoral artery."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," Firm pressure was held over the puncture site for 20 minutes followed by application of a sterile Coverlet dressing and a firm pressure dressing.,"

Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," Aspirin, Plavix, valsartan, Lipitor, and Norvasc."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," I am going to add Imdur and watch headaches as she apparently had some on nitro paste before, and we will rule out MI, although there is a little suspicion."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," I suppose it is possible that she has non-cardiac arm pain, but that seems less likely as it has been nitrate responsive and seems exertionally related and the other possibility may be that we end up needing to put in a pacemaker, so we can maximize beta-blocker use for anti-anginal effect."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," My concern is that there is persistent right coronary artery ischemia, not helped by left anterior descending percutaneous coronary intervention, which was severely stenotic and she does have normal LV function."

Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, He required 3 sublingual nitroglycerin in total (please see also admission history and physical for full details).
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary,", The patient underwent cardiac catheterization with myself today which showed mild-to-moderate left main distal disease of 30%, moderate proximal LAD with a severe mid-LAD lesion of 99%, and a mid-left circumflex lesion of 80% with normal LV function and some mild luminal irregularities in the right coronary artery with some moderate stenosis seen in the mid to distal right PDA."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary,", I discussed these results with the patient, and he had been relating to me that he was having rest anginal symptoms, as well as nocturnal anginal symptoms, and especially given the severity of the mid left anterior descending lesion, with a markedly abnormal stress test, I felt he was best suited for transfer for PCI."
